I am your guest host, Angela Jin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:30] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Angela:</strong> I am delighted to be guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing and to talk about the Contributor Mentorship Program, a community-driven initiative in the WordPress space that is proving to really support contributor journeys. And joining me today is special guest, Hari Shanker, Five for the Future Program Manager. Welcome, Hari!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:02] <strong>Hari:</strong> Thank you, Angela. Excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:04] <strong>Angela:</strong> Now, before we dive into the Contributor Mentorship Program, can you first tell me a bit about yourself? I&#8217;d love to know a bit more about your role as Five for the Future Program Manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:16] <strong>Hari:</strong> Sure. So, my name is Hari Shanker. I live in India in a city called Kochi. And I&#8217;d like to share some context to explain what I do. I am a sponsored contributor working full-time on WordPress, and I have been contributing primarily to the WordPress Community Team full-time since April 2020, where I am a Community Program Manager, formerly known as a Super Deputy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since September 2022, I have been working exclusively on projects that bolster the WordPress contributor experience. A key part of this work is my role as the Program Manager for the Five for the Future program, where my day-to-day work involves supporting and empowering companies and individuals that have pledged a part of their time to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:00] <strong>Hari:</strong> In parallel, I also lead the Contributor Working Group of the WordPress Community Team, which has the goal of making the contributor experience in WordPress the best it can be. Our recent focus has been on running an experimental contributor mentorship program as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Angela:</strong> Excellent. Thank you. So, I was recently at Open Source Summit, and figuring out funding and commitments to projects was a very hot topic. And people were really interested in Five for the Future. And so, Hari, would you mind giving us a quick overview of what Five for the Future is, and how it aims to support the WordPress open source project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:44] <strong>Hari:</strong> Absolutely. The Cofounder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg, launched Five for the Future in 2014 as a call to action for organizations and individuals who have benefited from WordPress, either the CMS or the community, to contribute up to 5 percent of their resources to the continued success of the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:03] <strong>Hari:</strong> In 2019, this idea was formalized as a program with a pledging page that lives in the URL WordPress.org/five. Right now, this program attempts to foster generous collaboration towards the long-term health and stability of our project for the future. So, like any large and successful open source project, WordPress has a lot of big goals and tasks, not all of which can be accomplished by volunteers in that available time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where sponsored contributors come in. Sponsored contributors have more time, availability, and bandwidth to make an impact on a lot of these tasks. They also work on some routine but important administrative and housekeeping tasks that are essential to keep the project running smoothly. At this time, the program has 868 contributors from 183 companies, who have pledged 7,722 hours of contribution time per week for the program. I can also share that roughly 70% of contribution activity in WordPress is coming from these sponsored contributors. That is the Five for the Future program in brief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:15] <strong>Angela:</strong> Thanks, Hari. That&#8217;s incredible that so much of our contribution comes through sponsored time and clearly is very necessary to keep the WordPress open source project running. Wonderful. All right, well, I would love to dig into the Contributor Mentorship Program. Can you tell us a bit more about how this came to be? What is the Contributor Mentorship Program?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:41] <strong>Hari:</strong> Oh, absolutely. It is one of my favorite programs and one of the best things that I&#8217;ve worked on personally. So, the Contributor Mentorship Program aims to onboard new contributors to WordPress by providing them one-on-one and cohort-based mentorship for a period of typically four to six weeks. The mentorship program typically coincides a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] <strong>Hari:</strong> And the idea behind the program is to help new contributors kickstart their WordPress contributor journey by providing them an in-depth overview of the WordPress project as well. To talk a bit about how this started, it all began in 2022-2023 when I started researching on the WordPress contributor experience. I discovered that there were gaps in the onboarding experience for new contributors. And I did some research on how we can solve this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, while those gaps can be fixed by improving the overall WordPress contributor onboarding experience through technical changes or changes in the program. Mentorship really stood out as an excellent solution to solve the problem. Based on my discovery from this research, I worked on revitalizing the WordPress Contributor Working Group of the Community Team. And together, our group we started working on building a mentorship program. We did a few months of collaborative discussions and brainstorming. And as a result, the group put together the idea for a pilot cohort-based mentorship program, which paired up 13 new contributors as mentees with one mentor each. The cohort worked together for four weeks, and 11 of these mentees graduated after making impactful contributions to the project, with over half of the cohort staying on to make long-term contributions. In fact, we just wrapped up the second cohort of the program in February 2024, which had 52 participants, of which 44 graduated from the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:34] <strong>Angela:</strong> Amazing. Congratulations. And I speaking just for myself, I know how important mentorship was to, to a lot of my journeys, both within WordPress and outside of, and so I think it&#8217;s wonderful that we&#8217;re able to bring mentorship to this space. What sort of benefits are there to participating in this program, either as a new WordPress contributor or as a mentor?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:04] <strong>Hari:</strong> There&#8217;s a bunch of benefits for both new contributors and mentors in this program, starting with new contributors. First and foremost, new participants in this program they get to kick off their WordPress contributor journey by making initial contributions. So, in my mind, the biggest benefit that they get is they get a chance to actually make their first contributions in the area of their choice with help from a mentor. The other main benefit that I see is that these mentees or new contributors. They get to learn a lot about the WordPress project and how it works. They get to learn about the WordPress release process broadly. And in short, participants in this program also get a chance to network with and learn from experienced WordPress contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this program is a great opportunity for mentees or new contributors to pick up a lot of valuable skills that they can use in the real world. For mentors, they also get a lot of benefits from this program. In fact, to share another anecdote, some of our mentors they contributed for the first time to WordPress core in the last cohort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:14] <strong>Hari:</strong> So, that is also something that they also get to learn, which means mentors also get to learn new skills when they be a part of this program. So, for mentors, even they get to enhance their skills, they get to expand the network within the WordPress community, but in my mind, the biggest benefit that they gain is they gain fulfillment from guiding new contributors. And personally, as a mentor myself, it&#8217;s one of the most valuable thing that you can gain from such a program. That feeling of belonging, that feeling of, you know, fostering sustainability and innovation in the project. I also feel that mentoring new contributors is a great way to bolster your leadership and communication skills, which is extremely valuable in any professional context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:54] <strong>Angela:</strong> Absolutely. I definitely see that being able to share your experience and mentor others is a really valuable way to help the next generation of WordPressers be successful in our space. Now, you&#8217;ve talked a bit about what results you&#8217;re seeing from this program, and it&#8217;s really exciting to see that so many mentees are successfully graduating from this program. I&#8217;d love to hear more about the impact and results that you&#8217;re seeing from the mentorship program. Could you give us more details there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Hari:</strong> Absolutely. So, I shared some numbers earlier. We had 11 mentees out of 13 graduating from the 2023 cohort and 44 outta 52 mentees from the 2024 Q1 cohort graduating. From the first cohort we have six of these mentees continuing to make impactful contributions to the project, but we have more encouraging results from the second cohort, in fact. So, ten of our mentees in the second cohort got props for contributing to WordPress 6.5, and one of our mentees was a noteworthy contributor. That&#8217;s about 22% of all the mentees. Fourteen mentees from the latest cohort, which is 31%, they have committed to join the WordPress 6.6 release squad. And the program actually gave eight new core contributors to the project, which includes mentors, as I mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:21] <strong>Hari:</strong> We did pre and post-cohort surveys, and the results are very interesting. I can definitely share some numbers here. So, we had a question on contributor familiarity. The familiarity of contribution for new contributors went up from 53% to 80%, that&#8217;s around 26% increase. The contribution confidence went from 57% to 82%, which is around 28%-29%. We asked if the mentees how many of these mentees were satisfied by the program. We heard that 88% of all the mentees were satisfied. 80% of mentees achieved their personal goals as part of the program. A key part of the program experience was that we asked mentees to create contribution plans to make future contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:06] <strong>Hari:</strong> 62% of our mentees actually made a future contribution plan. So which means, which is a 30, 60, 90-day plan. So, these mentees they&#8217;re gonna follow a plan to contribute to WordPress for the next three months. Finally, we also created a ton of learning materials for these mentees, and we are in the process of releasing them. So these are, most of these are videos, so we plan to release them in WordPress or TV and in the Learn WordPress platform. So, in my mind, seeing these mentees out in the world making impactful contributions that is the biggest impact that I&#8217;m seeing. So, having them in the project as long-term contributors. That is, in my mind, one of the biggest impacts that we&#8217;ve had from this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:46] <strong>Angela:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really incredible to see that new contributors to WordPress, upon joining this program, able to better navigate this vast ecosystem and make important contributions to our space. And that they&#8217;ve made these connections, so they are sticking around and staying with us and continuing to help us build WordPress. That&#8217;s incredible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:14] <strong>Angela:</strong> Now, I understand that between the first cohort and the second cohort, the Contributor Working Group made some important updates and iterated on the cohort itself. And one of the big changes, I understand, was to design cohorts around contributor projects. I&#8217;m curious now that we&#8217;ve talked about how fantastic this program is. Are there plans for future cohorts, and what might those cohorts look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:44] <strong>Hari:</strong> Absolutely. So, we have received a lot of interest in future cohorts. So, our working group just did a chat last week, and there was overwhelming positive interest and from all our working group members and other participants saying that we would love to be in a future cohort. So, short answer, yes, we will have a ton of these cohorts going forward. And we are, in fact, hosting a new cohort alongside WordPress 6.7. In October-November, 2024. And we will most likely continue to host at least one mentorship cohort every year. Ideally two, but I&#8217;m just saying one to make sure that we are sustainable. It is hard to predict how future cohorts will look like, but based on all the discussions our working group has had, I can definitely tell you how the next cohort is going to look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:35] <strong>Hari:</strong> So, as per current plans, we will have around 20 to 30 mentees supported by mentors. And the cohort will most likely start early on in the 6.7 release process. The idea is that we would like our mentees to be more deeply involved in the 6.7 release as early as possible. We also plan to have a lot more learn-up sessions in the next cohort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One feedback that we heard was our mentees really enjoyed some of the learn-up sessions, and they would like these sessions to be scheduled in advance as much as possible so that they can attend as many of them as possible. So, more learn-up sessions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:14] <strong>Hari:</strong> And finally, you mentioned projects when you spoke of the latest cohort. We are going to double down on projects in the next cohort. So the hope is to have a host of projects for folks to work on and, ideally, have all mentees work on some project or the other. So, we had projects as an experiment for the earlier cohort. Some mentees did work on projects, while some they were broadly contributing. So, ideally, for the next cohort, every mentee in the program will be a part of some project or the other. It could be a small one. It could be a big one, but there will be some project of some sort for every mentee in the program, ideally. And finally, some contributors in our cohort, they received a scholarship to participate in the last cohort. We hope to expand that. We hope to provide more opportunities for scholarship for contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:05] <strong>Hari:</strong> I&#8217;m not sure how viable it is, but we did see that the folks who received scholarship, they got a chance to contribute more. So we would ideally like to provide more opportunities for scholarship, especially for folks from underrepresented backgrounds, so that they can contribute to WordPress and, you know, upskill as part of this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Angela:</strong> Fantastic. Well, hopefully, we have convinced our listeners today to get involved in the Contributor Mentorship Program. And so, if somebody wanted to get involved, either as a mentee or a mentor, how should they go about doing so?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] <strong>Hari:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. We have not opened up signups for mentors and mentees for the next cohort yet. As I mentioned, it&#8217;s going to happen later this year. However, those interested in the next cohort of the program can comment on the post. I think we can share the link in the show notes. We just published a post announcing the graduation of our mentees, and we had asked folks who are interested in joining the next cohort comment there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:07] <strong>Hari:</strong> So if you&#8217;re interested in joining the next cohort, either as a mentor or a mentee. You can comment on that post. Alternatively, you can also DM me. If you&#8217;re not comfortable commenting in a public space, my name is Hari Shanker. I am Hari Shanker, which is H-A-R-I-S-H-A-N-K-E-R. That&#8217;s my username in the Make WordPress Slack. You can DM me there expressing your interest, and I will make sure that we send you the call for interest form when it&#8217;s published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, and this is especially to all the mentor applicants, we have a Contributor Working Group, which meets every third Thursday of the month in the Community Team channel on a text chat. It&#8217;s called a mentorship chat. It happens every month, and you can find a link to it in the Make WordPress meetings, P2 blog. So, if you&#8217;re interested in being a mentor, or if you&#8217;re interested in building the Contributor Mentorship Program, or contributing to the Contributor Mentorship Program, I would invite you to join our chat. So, the next chat is being held in May. Please join our next chat. That&#8217;s also a great way to contribute to this program, especially if you are interested in being a mentor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:10] <strong>Angela:</strong> Wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me today, Hari. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:16] <strong>Hari:</strong> Thank you. It&#8217;s been an honor, and thank you for inviting me to be a part of this program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:19]&nbsp;(Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:27] <strong>Angela:</strong> And now it is time for our small list of big things. We&#8217;ve got three things for you this week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is a proposal to explore the Support Team contributor ladder. If you are not familiar with the concept of the contributor ladder, it is based on the five stages of volunteering, which examines how a volunteer gets onboarded and steps into progressive roles. By thinking through the contributor ladder, Make WordPress teams are able to improve onboarding, engagement, and connection with contributors and generally improve the health of their team. If this is of interest to you, we have a great overview post about the contributor ladder, and you can see the discussion in action over on the Support Team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:14] <strong>Angela:</strong> Second, is that the WordPress Foundation has just announced the Kim Parcell Memorial Scholarship for 2024. This scholarship is in honor of Kim Parcell, an incredible long-time contributor, and is awarded to a current WordPress contributor who is a woman, has not previously attended WordCamp US, and requires financial assistance to attend this year&#8217;s event.&nbsp;The scholarship will provide travel assistance for the recipient to attend WordCamp US this year in Portland, Oregon, and covers travel from your home city, hotel, and your ticket to the event. The application is open through May 30th, and you can apply on the WordPress Foundation page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third is a reminder of our next big WordPress event, WordCamp Europe, which will be in beautiful Torino, Italy, June 13th through the 15th. You can still get tickets on their website. If you can&#8217;t make it to Italy, never fear. This time of year sees a good number of WordPress events around the world, and they are a great way to connect with WordPress friends and hear all about the latest and greatest in WordPress. You can go find upcoming events on events.WordPress.org to see what events are happening in your area. If there isn&#8217;t a WordPress event near you, you can become an organizer and start hosting events locally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:42] <strong>Angela:</strong> And that, friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app. Or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

That’s a massive reach—one that comes with a similarly large responsibility. With so many people using the CMS, the WordPress community should always consider strategies for improving the visitor experience. This is where website performance plays a crucial role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How fast a web page loads, how quickly a page reacts when you click a button, or how smoothly it scrolls can all significantly impact the end-user experience. A more performant site can lead to <a href=\"https://web.dev/case-studies/vitals-business-impact\">higher reader engagement and more conversions</a>. Thankfully, over the past few years, the WordPress project has made major performance improvements across the board for the core platform, plugins, and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many enhancements are available out of the box, with no configuration required. They improve the website frontend&#8217;s performance—the part visitors see—and various parts of the administrative experience, such as the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a partial list of performance upgrades from the past year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 6.3 brought several <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/19/analyzing-the-core-web-vitals-performance-impact-of-wordpress-6-3-in-the-field/\">enhancements to image loading</a>. This resulted in an improvement of up to 21% in loading time for any WordPress page with a hero image.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress 6.5 launched with a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">more efficient translation engine</a>. In benchmark testing, it improved WordPress response time by 23% for all localized WordPress sites. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">More than 55% of all WordPress sites</a> worldwide use a language other than US English and would benefit from this enhancement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress 6.5 also included several performance optimizations for the Block Editor, leading to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">5x faster typing processing and 2x faster load times</a> when creating or editing content in the site and post editors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the Core enhancements listed above, the WordPress project continues to work on several efforts that indirectly benefit the ecosystem&#8217;s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, WordPress Core leverages <a href=\"https://codehealth.vercel.app/project/wordpress\">automated tooling for continuously monitoring its performance</a>, covering every product update. This helps measure new features&#8217; performance improvements and enables contributors to detect potential performance problems during the development of a new feature or release so any issues can be proactively addressed long before end users are affected. A project is currently underway to make the same tooling used by WordPress Core developers available to plugin and theme authors as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/\">WordPress plugin checker</a> allows checking any plugin for performance best practices, among other requirements and recommendations. The plugin checker should lead to more performance awareness in plugin authors and, eventually, faster plugins. If you develop plugins, consider integrating this tool into your development and testing workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, WordPress 6.5 introduced the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/04/interactivity-api-dev-note/\">Interactivity API</a>, which is a technical foundation that facilitates more performant user interactions. This new infrastructure drastically simplifies the implementation of interactive website features and can even centrally control certain aspects of performance, keeping multiple independent plugins operating efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These performance updates result from a collaborative effort from all corners of the community, including the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/about-the-team/\">WordPress Performance Team</a>. This team, founded in 2021, underscores the WordPress project’s commitment to performance. And the results are substantial: Compared to a year ago, 8% more WordPress sites <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/12/19/wordpress-performance-impact-on-core-web-vitals-in-2023/\">deliver good load time performance at scale</a>—significantly better than the overall web’s 5.5% load time improvement. The web is getting more performant, and WordPress is leading the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress contributors are determined to continue this trend by working on further performance iterations. Whether you’re a WordPress end user, administrator, site builder, or developer, you can contribute to this effort. Anyone can test the performance features before being released in Core through individual feature plugins. Each feature can be tested via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab plugin</a>, so please try them! Testing features early helps the team assess their impact and collect valuable feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you eager for more WordPress performance news and updates? Then check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/roadmap-2024/\">2024 performance roadmap</a>. Thanks to the entire community for your hard work.

Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Today, I want to talk about the Data Liberation project that we first introduced at State of the Word. It&#8217;s a very big project with a lot of philosophical underpinning. So today, I have with me Jordan Gillman, who&#8217;s going to help us dig in a little bit deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jordan, welcome to the show. It&#8217;s so great to have you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:57] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Thank you. It&#8217;s lovely to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Before we get started, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself? Like what parts of the WordPress project you contribute to, and how long you&#8217;ve been hanging around in open source?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:09] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, beautiful. I would love to. My name is Jordan. I live on the east coast of Australia, about an hour out of Sydney—about 10 minutes from the beach, which is a pretty great place to live. My relationship with WordPress began 19 or 18 years ago, I guess. I was tinkering with Movable Type, and they changed their license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I went, I need to find something that&#8217;s free. And at that point, I had no idea what open source was. I just knew that I could use this WordPress platform for free to you know, tinker around and build websites. At the time, I was a graphic designer and, so web stuff was just fun. But gradually, that kind of took over, and I ended up doing a lot of front-end development and eventually freelancing for about ten years, building WordPress sites for churches and schools and kind of non-profit organizations like that. And through that, I&#8217;ve also then ended up doing some support for WordPress and landed being lucky enough now to be sponsored to contribute full-time into the WordPress project. I do a lot of work with the support team, so working in the public forums, particularly on core WordPress plugins and themes like Gutenberg and bundled themes, Twenty Twenty-Four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:15] <strong>Jordan:</strong> But also working with the team itself, trying to make sure the forums are a nice place for people to hang out and answer questions and get their questions answered. And I also help out with a few other things around the place. I have an eye on the work the plugins team&#8217;s doing, working with the WordPress Foundation on a few different things. I&#8217;m lucky to have my fingers in a few pies but the biggest pie at the moment I have is the Data Liberation project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:36] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So let&#8217;s talk about that. We&#8217;re going to give everyone a quick like starting line. If, for some reason, you have not read or seen anything about the WordPress project plans so far in the last four months, you may not know what the Data Liberation project is, and that&#8217;s fine, too. Because Jordan and I are here to help you understand what it is. But, the Data Liberation project is something that Matt introduced to the project at State of the Word last year in December. And you, Jordan, are the one who are really helping us to take this project into a space where we have everything that we need, all the kind of tools and guides that users will need in order to do what exactly? Like, let&#8217;s go through what this Data Liberation project is from your standpoint and what made you excited to work on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:27] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Thank you. Yeah, so the general idea of the Data Liberation project is it should be super duper easy for anyone to bring their site to WordPress. That&#8217;s the first main part of it, is that regardless of the platform you are on currently, be it something that&#8217;s pretty open, be it something that&#8217;s really kind of walls and closed, be it a social media platform, another web building platform, it should be really easy to bring your content over to a WordPress site, because once it&#8217;s in a WordPress site, it&#8217;s essentially free. You can then take it and do what you want with it once it&#8217;s in WordPress, but we want to make it as easy as possible to get it here, basically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Free as in liberated, not free as in like, now the stuff that was in your mind has no value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, free as in liberated, free as in you own it and can do what you want with it. So that&#8217;s a big part of it. It&#8217;s, let&#8217;s get, make it easier for people to come to WordPress. I think it&#8217;s also important that if we&#8217;re talking about Data Liberation and freedom of content and democratizing publishing, that also means we make it easier for people to take their content from WordPress and use it somewhere else if that&#8217;s the decision that they make. And there&#8217;s some moves we can make to make that easier and nicer for people as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So, recently, we just finished up an outreach period where we were making sure that we were talking to, like, folks in the community and anyone, anyone who uses WordPress that wanted to talk to us about what they needed, what they were hoping for, what issues, what pain points they&#8217;ve had when they were looking at site migrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what, to the best of your knowledge at the moment, like what are the big themes that you got out of that feedback loop? Out of that outreach?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:08] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, thank you. That was really enjoyable, actually. I was lucky enough to, I got to speak to a bunch of people in person at WordCamp Asia, which was great. We&#8217;d done some, some online, did a hallway hangout, and we&#8217;ve had a survey out for a while to folks predominantly kind of in the hosting agency freelancer space. So, folks who are working with end users who are often the ones doing migrations. We got a lot of feedback about WordPress to WordPress migration and the challenges of different hosting platforms and access from users and a bunch of information, which is useful and interesting but not immediately relevant to the comparison to migrating to WordPress from another platform entirely.<br><br>But at the same time, talking to particularly agencies who do a lot of big-scale migrations, there&#8217;s a lot of challenges just when it comes to, for starters, getting the content out of the platform. Some platforms are kind of helpful, and they&#8217;ll even provide a WordPress formatted export. For every one of those, there are&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:03] <strong><strong>Josepha:</strong> </strong>That&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:05] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, those are super helpful. For every one of those there are probably two or three who aren&#8217;t as helpful, and you start to resort to tricks with, you know, manually exporting databases or getting RSS feeds and trying to convert them, or a lot of agencies said, &#8220;You know what? Often, we end up just copying and pasting page by page from the source site into a brand-new WordPress site.&#8221;<br><br>[00:06:27] <strong>Jordan:</strong> So, there&#8217;s challenges about the access to the content. There&#8217;s lots of challenges around getting the content from the shape of one platform into WordPress. What constitutes a page? What constitutes a post? How do we handle all of the extra metadata of images and dates and taxonomies, and anything else that might be associated with a blob of content in one platform?<br><br>How do we translate that into the way WordPress likes to handle those things? And particularly taking that to another level, even just bringing it into the Block Editor? It was great to hear how many people are just migrating straight to the Block Editor like they want the content in blocks, which is wonderful to hear.<br><br>[00:07:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yay!<br><br>[00:07:05] <strong>Jordan:</strong> But there are challenges. I know it&#8217;s great. But there are some, there are challenges with that and getting it to kind of format the way they expect, when it comes in particularly because there&#8217;s some kind of functional challenges with that in validating the way the content comes in because it all happens client side in the browser. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to do that in big batches. So, there was some really great feedback around all of those kinds of places. It was really interesting to see how much of it centers around that getting the content and then getting the content, and yeah, for the agencies I spoke to, they do a lot of trial and error of, you know, custom scripts, and let&#8217;s try it. Oh, that did this. Let&#8217;s try again with a few tweaks. So I&#8217;m excited to see how we can kind of make that easier for them and, you know, maybe get it happening first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It has been a long time since I migrated any sites personally, but I remember the first time that I tried to migrate a site. So, I was on Xanga before Xanga was on WordPress, and I remember that when I was like, I can&#8217;t figure out this WordPress thing, but I think I need some stuff in it so that, like, I know what it&#8217;s going to look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know what to move around cause I didn&#8217;t know the names for anything in, in CSS or HTML. Like I didn&#8217;t know what to look for in the code, but if I had a piece of content in it, I could be like, find the content in the code and then move that. And so I was like, I&#8217;m going to export everything because there was an export option in Xanga. And move it into WordPress, and WordPress was like if you can manage to get it out of Xanga, super easy to get it in. But it was actually really difficult to figure out how to get it out. And fortunately, I&#8217;d only been writing on it for like four years, three, four years at that point. So there wasn&#8217;t like, a huge amount of content, but also, I was a pretty prolific writer. I was a bad writer, but the only way to get better at things you&#8217;re bad at is to do it a lot. So, I did a lot of bad writing for three or four years. And I think that in the end, I did, like, just pay some service to scrape everything that was public on it, and then go through and get the private things and pull it out later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think later on down the road, I did an actual like full migration when it was easier to get it done and got all the content out, including like drafts and private posts and things. So that&#8217;s good. But yeah, it was really difficult then. And then, like, we have the blocks now that are supposed to help get a little bit more consistency in the way that you can move content in and out of a WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is that something that we are then focusing on with the Data Liberation project? Is that something that&#8217;s being done in concert with our Gutenberg plugin, or like how are we accounting for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:46] <strong>Jordan:</strong> That is a great question. The way things are looking at the moment, having come out of this feedback and the way we&#8217;re looking at going forward that, that work on getting content coming into blocks is going to be a really, really major part of Data Liberation. And it kind of sits in the middle of things to my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:01] <strong>Jordan:</strong> The improvements that we can make with handling the way content is transformed into blocks gives us the potential of wins in a lot of places. So, as long as we can get to the content, this work on HTML to blocks for a better, lack of a better way of putting it, gives us wins with importing from another platform because we can take the content in whatever form it is, turn it into blocks in the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gives us wins with migrating from classic editor because, similarly, we can take the HTML of the classic editor generates and turn it into blocks. That already kind of happens, but there&#8217;s definitely some work that we can do to keep improving that. It gives us potential wins around the spaces of moving from between proprietary builders and block libraries and things. Because if we start to have a better-standardized set of ways to handle HTML into blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you can essentially move from whatever form your content is in into, you know, core native blocks in the editor. So, I think work there is going to be really important because it gives us a foundation to aim for from whatever the migration is happening from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] <strong>Jordan:</strong> So, there&#8217;ll be some work there. There&#8217;s already work happening on the HTML API. Like, ongoingly and regularly and so we&#8217;ll be talking to those folks. There&#8217;s obviously going to be a lot of overlap with the work within Gutenberg as well, which is doing you know, parsing of content into blocks. So, it&#8217;s going to take a lot of collaboration and a lot of work from everyone, but I&#8217;m really excited because if we can get that foundational platform of transforming HTML into blocks really, really smooth, then what we can do is we can, you know, activate contributors in the community say, we&#8217;ve got this part figured out. If you can get it to here, it&#8217;s going to come in beautifully. So what we want your help with is to say, how do I get out of this platform to a format that we can do the rest? So, hopefully, we&#8217;re getting a common flow for a big part of that important migration process. And then we can throw it open to others to say, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got expertise with this platform. That&#8217;s excellent. Can you get us to here? And we&#8217;ll take it from there.&#8221; And maybe we&#8217;ll get some wins by doing that work in parallel, and we&#8217;ll really start to see some movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And speaking of the, we&#8217;ll take it from there. I know that also, in addition to the work that you are doing with Data Liberation and that is happening on the Gutenberg side and WordPress core in general, we also have a little bit of work happening on the after you get it to here point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the folks over at Playground have been doing a bit of research about how to use the guides and tools that are in the Data Liberation repo. To run all of that through Playground so that you can not only like import it, but you can put it into Playground and check it before you launch it in someplace else, which I think is a great user-facing, like, super important thing for an everyday user to be able to have at their fingertips that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also the tour plugin that was built, I think specifically for the Polyglots team, is where we are looking at using, and I can&#8217;t remember which little project we&#8217;re doing some research on to make this possible, but we&#8217;re looking at taking that tour plugin and making it so that anyone can build a tour on anyone&#8217;s version of something in a browser so that you can just say, okay, so I did these things. I got it to here as you requested. I&#8217;m moving it to here. But now that I have got it into WordPress, what are the literal buttons I have to press in order to make sure it&#8217;s live? What do I literally have to press in order to make sure that I&#8217;m in the right time zone? Like, things like that. And we tested it on Wix, and it was able to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Not that we&#8217;re trying to get anyone to Wix. But on the subject of, like, getting things out of WordPress and into someone else, that sounds counterintuitive for folks, like, you&#8217;re here listening to a WordPress podcast, and we&#8217;re talking about how and why we want to make it easier for people to get their content to us, of course, but then also, if needed, get it out of a version of WordPress and either into a different version of WordPress with a new host or, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if this is not your long-term destination, which we think it will be once you figure us out, but like, if it&#8217;s not, like, how to get out of it, too. So, from your perspective, how does that fit with the basic philosophies of open source or of WordPress in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:24] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, thank you. If I may, there&#8217;s a couple of things I wanted to touch on from what you&#8217;ve said. First of all the other work that is going on in the project at the moment that you mentioned, the tour guide and the Playground, I think both of those are going to be super important to the approach we take to Data Liberation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to elaborate just a little bit on the Playground because I&#8217;m particularly excited about the potential that gives for two particular scenarios two particular use cases for migration. One is, where I&#8217;ve already set up a WordPress site, I&#8217;ve got the theme that I&#8217;d like, and I&#8217;ve got some, you know, some plugins, maybe I&#8217;ve got a little bit there, but I want to import content, but I want to check how it is the potential for the Playground to make essentially a staging copy of my site and migrate the content into that staging copy so I can see how it lands in my chosen theme and check everything out and then go, yep, that looks great. And apply it. That&#8217;s great for it&#8217;s safe. You can check how it looks before it&#8217;s, you know, committed. So that&#8217;s brilliant. I&#8217;m excited about that. I&#8217;m also excited about the potential it has for people who don&#8217;t know WordPress, or don&#8217;t have a WordPress site, or they don&#8217;t have a host, they don&#8217;t have anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Jordan:</strong> But if they can say, I want to see how this would go in WordPress. Playground, through some platform, somewhere, will allow them to just have an immediate in-browser preview of what their site would look like on WordPress. And if they like it, we then move them. We help them find a host. We help them export that in a way that they can use, but it helps the people who already have sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think, more importantly, it helps those who don&#8217;t have a site yet. And they don&#8217;t have to set up an empty WordPress install in order to start migrating. They can just get into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And also, you don&#8217;t have to, like know who your host needs to be before you can take a look at the back end of a WordPress site and see if it makes sense to you. Like I think that that is a huge, huge win on behalf of users, current users, and future users of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the try before you buy. Come kick our tires without having to find a server. If you all don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, if you have not heard of Playground yet, you can go to playground.WordPress.net and give it a try. It&#8217;s a one-click, serverless local version of WordPress that you can test out themes on and plugins, and just like put all your data into all your content into, and pretty soon also be able to export or just load directly onto the host of your choice. It&#8217;s really, really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:44] <strong>Jordan:</strong> It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s pretty much magic, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:47] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes, I remember the first hackathon where we took it because we took it basically on a hackathon roadshow for six months. I remember the first one we took it to. Routinely, we could get developers, not me, routinely, Adam Zieliński could get a developer to do the thing, and they&#8217;d be like, I can do it if you&#8217;re next to me telling me what to do, but it&#8217;s literal magic. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening. And he was like, okay, I&#8217;ll come explain it to you. And like, he was using English, but also I was like, that is still magic. I&#8217;m so glad someone understands it. It&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:18] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, so the Playground I&#8217;m super excited by. I think it&#8217;s going to be really important. The tour stuff the tour functionality is going to be really important as well. Because on some level, We&#8217;re going to have to wrap all of this work on improving HTML to blocks, the process of taking an export file and importing it into WordPress, the process of telling people how to get the content, all that&#8217;s going to have to be ideally wrapped up in a nice user-friendly way so that users aren&#8217;t having to, you know, read plain text articles and then going and installing a plugin and all of those kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the potential for the tours is we may have some kind of wrapper plugin or something which will detect the platform of your existing site if you put the URL in, and it will start walking you through the steps. So, part of that might be action you need to take on your existing platform, and we have some of that information already in the guides on the Data Liberation site at WordPress.org/data-liberation. That information is already there, but I&#8217;m hoping that we can start pulling those guides into the WP Admin so you just get walked through it while you&#8217;re there. And we can start using the tour functionality to really specifically pinpoint: you need to go here, now you can do this, go and click this, and just walk users through that migration process a little bit more neatly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:37] <strong>Jordan:</strong> I&#8217;m really excited that we&#8217;re going to be able to utilize a lot of these existing projects that are exciting and happening at the moment. And I think, ideally, they&#8217;re all going to make it much easier for users to not have to jump through so many hoops. And the hoops that they do have to jump through, we can hold their hand while they do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Create safe scaffolding for fun, I used to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] <strong>Jordan:</strong> So those are the two projects existing that are happening at the moment that I&#8217;m excited about rolling into and working with for the Data Liberation work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:07] <strong>Jordan:</strong> You also asked about the getting content back out, which is something that I&#8217;m particularly passionate about, I suppose. Which may be ironic when a lot of the aim of this project is to get people into WordPress. But I&#8217;m a really firm believer that if our mission is to democratize publishing, then that doesn&#8217;t mean just get everyone onto WordPress and go, yes, now you&#8217;re trapped. It&#8217;s like the Hotel California, you can never leave. If we&#8217;re going to be, you know, fully all in on democratizing publishing, then that means giving folks the freedom to take their content to do with it, whatever they want. It&#8217;s fair to say at the moment that that is possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can export your content from WordPress. We don&#8217;t hang onto it. We don&#8217;t lock it down. You can take it. At the moment, the format that you get that content in has some limitations. It&#8217;s fair to say it doesn&#8217;t handle bringing the media of your site particularly well unless you&#8217;re turning it into another WordPress site somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the export functionality is very, very focused at the moment on migration to another host, or to a local site, or to another WordPress installation, basically. But if you want to use that content for something else, maybe another platform. Maybe you just want to have a copy of your blog posts that you can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Print it into a book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, to put into a book. Maybe you want to put it on a thumb drive and put it in a lockbox somewhere. Maybe you want some kind of hundred-year archive of your intellectual property that you&#8217;ve written and created. And so I think we&#8217;ve got some room to make improvements there. Not only to the way we provide content for other platforms to pick up and bring in but also just in the ways that we provide content to users who just really want to have a physical, digital copy of what they&#8217;ve created.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some challenges at the moment when you get an export, if you&#8217;ve got shortcodes in your content, if you&#8217;ve got content that&#8217;s generated by plugins, all kinds of dynamic content that is great when it&#8217;s a website, and WordPress is wonderful. And there&#8217;s all of these options, but if you take an export, you have references to those functions, and you have references to those shortcodes, which aren&#8217;t actually fully realized. So I think there&#8217;s some room for us to investigate what does a better export for other platforms look like and what does a better export for &#8220;I want to print it out or turn it into a book or just have a static version of that&#8221; content look like. And so I&#8217;m particularly excited about that, even though it&#8217;s kind of, bring it in, and we want to let them get it out. But that&#8217;s part of the whole liberation of data, I suppose, is, you know, the freedom to do with it what you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And everything that increases freedom on the open web, I think we are in favor of. So, I don&#8217;t know if you follow many, like WordPress futurists, our people who are out there saying, if only WordPress had these additional 2,500 hours worth of work, then we could do this with it. Like, I don&#8217;t know if you follow a lot of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But, a lot of them look at that thing that Matt said, like, I want to say, five years ago about WordPress becoming the operating system of the web and putting some thought into what would be required to make that possible. And when we look at composable CMSs, like the option to have something that is a framework and a core of what you are doing in your digital experience of the web. And making it possible to add anything to it required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that also the work that we&#8217;re doing with Data Liberation to provide a little bit more consistency and just standardization of the way that content comes in and out, I think, can only help with that potential future implementation of WordPress as the operating system for the web so that you have this basic place where you hold and manage all your content and also not only does WordPress cooperate nicely with all these other tools and applications that you can put on top of it but also all of the content has standard conversational touch points and so everything moves quickly in and out including the dynamic content that is maybe being created inside your WordPress core itself. I think that is also a really important not primary focus, but certainly future-like, if only we could get to that state kind of focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:31] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m really interested. I think that the Data Liberation project is big, and I know that we expected primarily only new contributors to work on it, but honestly, we know that&#8217;s not the case. It&#8217;s you&#8217;re working on old WordPress in here and so not necessarily new contributors. But I think that you&#8217;re right that the place for new contributors to help us is saying like we can get the content to here, we can get the data to here, and then we need help getting it into WordPress or help getting it into something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as like a last question here, or if you have things to add to that, and then I can do last question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:04] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Okay, so to loop back to your conversation about futurists and moving content and stuff, I am really excited about this idea that the open web at the moment, I think, is really, really exciting. I just started mucking around with federating my content in the fediverse. Again, recently, I tried it a little while ago and really struggled, but I&#8217;ve just started again, and it&#8217;s sitting really comfortably with me, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s feeling like it&#8217;s a great time for posting and owning your content, and then syndicating it elsewhere. I have seen a couple of really interesting conversations about what you were saying about, like I&#8217;ve seen the conversations in the past about, you know, operating system of the web, but also some talk and ideas recently about what would it look like if we stored all of our data in a WordPress instance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if all of my photos aren&#8217;t on Instagram? They are on my WordPress site. What if I pull in my Fitbit or my Strava information and just store it in WordPress so that I can do with it what I want once it&#8217;s there? What if I, I don&#8217;t know, what if I pull in kind of all of my different sources of data and I, and I house them in WordPress and then I can do with them what they want, would do with them what I want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:08] <strong>Jordan:</strong> And that is when the Data Liberation stuff becomes especially important because if it&#8217;s your everything, you want to take your everything somewhere else. But I&#8217;m really excited for kind of all of that kind of space at the moment and giving people the freedom to own that data and when they create stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In actual fact, this is one of the things that you said in your talk at WordCamp Asia, which has really stuck with me was, and I can&#8217;t remember the exact phrase, but you said if you&#8217;re going to do all of this work of creating something, you may as well do it somewhere where you own it and can keep it. And that, for me, is just such a strong driver for getting people onto WordPress. Particularly from, at the moment, social media platforms. I&#8217;ve got two young daughters who are just getting to the age where they&#8217;re creating videos at home, which aren&#8217;t being published anywhere, but they&#8217;re starting to. They&#8217;ve got friends who are doing YouTube channels, and they&#8217;ve got friends on Instagram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m looking at all of that going, I get the urge to create, and I get the urge to publish, but I want them to have an alternative to do all of that so that in five years&#8217; time, ten years time, whatever it is, when they go, wow, I did all of this stuff. I don&#8217;t want that owned by someone else. I&#8217;ve created all this, and I&#8217;m excited by the possibility of having that become a simpler, more user-friendly, accessible option to folks, where it becomes just as easy to have a WordPress site, which is your Instagram feed or a WordPress site, which is your YouTube channel or something like that, where you own it, and you just create it, and it exists. And Data Liberation means you want to take a copy of all that stuff, go for it, download an archive, you know, print out the photos, do whatever you want, but they&#8217;re yours. You have them. And so, it&#8217;s really feeling like all of that is coalescing together a little bit at the moment. I think it&#8217;s a really exciting time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And also, like, since we&#8217;re just meandering around in philosophical spaces, two philosophical thoughts. One, I really, really feel like it&#8217;s important and valuable for people to document their lives. I have a pretty private social media presence; mostly, if you&#8217;re following me on social media, it&#8217;s because, like, you have literally been in my living room or you&#8217;re looking for WordPress news. Like that&#8217;s it. But I am constantly am documenting my life just for myself, like the folks who are listening, which is everybody, because we don&#8217;t do video, will not know that I have back behind me a shelf that is nothing but journals from my leadership journey, like from the moment that I realized that like leadership was something that was a skill and could change people&#8217;s lives like I&#8217;ve done nothing but document like I ran into this problem. This is the research that I did to figure out what was happening and not, and just like it&#8217;s really mundane things in my work now. But the work and the process of documenting, like, what&#8217;s happening for you and with you in your life and how you&#8217;re interacting with it, like, it&#8217;s just important for your mental health and for your understanding of the passage of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But then also you were talking about, like, having a hundred-year archive of your thoughts and things, like, there will be a point at which digital information being ephemeral because it&#8217;s just electricity wandering around between screens, like, it&#8217;s prone to getting lost in the same way that physical things are prone to getting lost, but the loss is less acute in the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you can accidentally lose it. And I think that that&#8217;s a real long-term not problem for society necessarily, but I think it is something from a societal standpoint where we&#8217;re gonna, at some point in the near future, realize that some of us have huge missing gaps where we, like just got rid of everything that we ever documented because we had a moment on social media or because it seemed like the only way to reclaim our content or our data or our privacy or whatever it was. And so I have a yeah. I love it. I love everything that we&#8217;re talking about, about the speculative future and WordPress. And so yes, now, well, now everybody knows all my thoughts on speculative WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:06] <strong>Jordan:</strong> There&#8217;s an interesting philosophical conversation which we&#8217;re like coming towards of what&#8217;s the equivalent in a hundred years, in 200 years of now, of the Library of Congress for philosophical and powerful writing. There is so much great stuff that is written on the web, and it just exists there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a hundred years, when people are writing about the early work of an artist or a politician or, you know, a notable figure, we don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re not going to have handwritten letters. We&#8217;re not going to have correspondence. But we&#8217;ll have tweets. We could have blog posts. Like, it interests me to think, like, the stuff that we take for granted of historical creation is happening digitally now. And so, equivalently, in the future, how, how is that gonna get retained? How much amazing knowledge and thinking is gonna just, you know, have their hosting account expire and get removed? And it&#8217;s an, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a big conversation, but it&#8217;s an interesting one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Oh, what a fascinating discussion we&#8217;ve had today. So, by way of wrapping up our discussion here, why don&#8217;t you give us a sense for, like, if you are a user of WordPress and you were like, this sounds really interesting, I want to learn more, where can they go? But also, if you are someone who wants to learn how to contribute to WordPress and this sounds like a good opportunity for you to get started with that. Where can people find more about this project, about how to get started, how to contribute, all that stuff?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:38] <strong>Jordan:</strong> If you are someone who is hearing about this for the first time and coming to it pretty fresh and haven&#8217;t been working in the WordPress community much before. The best place to go will be WordPress.org/data-liberation, that will give you not only access to the tools and guides that exist but also some information on where the development and discussion is happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the easiest pathway to find your way into those conversations as well. For folks who already have a little bit of experience and, it may be contributed code or a part of discussions already. The place to go to would be github.com/WordPress/data-liberation. That&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a lot of discussion. That&#8217;s where the existing tools and guides are being managed and worked on. So, if you really want to dive in. Please come and join us there. There are discussions to be had. There are ideas to be floated. That&#8217;s where all of the boots-on-the-ground work is going to be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:25] <strong>Jordan:</strong> The other great place is within the Make WordPress Slack organization. And we have a Data Liberation channel in there. That is primarily where we have higher-level conversations, and we chat about stuff, and I&#8217;m hoping that becomes a real hub for work-adjacent discussion. So GitHub is going to be for all of this is where all the work&#8217;s happening, but the Slack channel is where people can share their thoughts on what&#8217;s possible, and big picture ideas, and that kind of stuff. So those will be the three best places. WordPress.org/data-liberation for the overview, github.com/WordPress/data-liberation for where the work&#8217;s actually happening, and WordPress Slack in the Data Liberation channel. If you want to come and chat more about the possibilities and, you know, helping get the future of the open web happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I mean, that is an enticing call to action. We&#8217;ll have links to all of the, all three of those in the show notes, as well as links to everything that we kind of mentioned over the course of our conversation. But Jordan, thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:32] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Thank you so much for having me. It&#8217;s been great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:34] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got three things for you this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing on the list is that WordCamp US tickets are now on sale. So that event is happening from September 17th through the 20th in Portland, Oregon. There are general admission tickets and micro sponsor tickets available. And if you have seen the cost of the ticket but had not quite noted the length of the event, I just want to assure you that the cost per day is the same now as it was and has been for years. It&#8217;s still that same 25-dollar-a-day ticket that you&#8217;ve got; it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s four days long this time. We&#8217;ll have a link to the tickets in the show notes, but then also you can always wander over to us.wordcamp.org, and it&#8217;ll take you right there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our list is that WordPress 6.5 is here. It is named Regina. If you listened to our show last week, you know that it was a huge release and kind of has something for everyone. So, if you have not yet downloaded it to take a look at it, do that. If you have not updated your sites yet, run a backup because you should always do a backup and then get that on your site and start testing everything out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our big list, our small list of big things, is actually that we&#8217;re looking at dropping support for PHP 7. 0 and 7. 1 in upcoming releases of WordPress this year. It should not be too disruptive a change. However, it is going to take a lot of people to test it and make sure that everything&#8217;s working as we want it to work and as we need it to work. And so while we head toward that, I want to make sure you&#8217;ve got the resources that you need to know what&#8217;s happening, where it&#8217;s happening, how it&#8217;s going to affect you. I&#8217;ll leave some resources in the show notes for that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser, or if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:54] (Music outro)&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17205\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 6.5.2 Maintenance and Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/04/wordpress-6-5-2-maintenance-and-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Apr 2024 22:00:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17195\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"Note: Due to an issue with the initial package, WordPress 6.5.1 was not released. 6.5.2 is the first minor release for WordPress 6.5.

Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Dave, I&#8217;m so excited to have you here with us today. Welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:42] <strong>Dave:</strong> Thank you. I&#8217;m really excited to be here. Thank you so much for inviting me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So before we get much further, how about you tell us a little bit about what you do on the WordPress project? And if I recall correctly, that you have a role on the release squad. So just let us know a bit about what that role is and what that looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Sure. Absolutely. Well, obviously said I&#8217;m Dave Smith. I&#8217;m from England in the United Kingdom, and I am full-time contributor to WordPress. I&#8217;ve focused primarily on the Block Editor during that time. And I&#8217;ve been doing it for about three years now. And fortunately for me, I am sponsored by Automattic, so that allows me to contribute full-time to the project, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my history of WordPress goes back a fair way longer than that, and I used to work in agency land, and so I used WordPress for making things for a living before I worked in WordPress if you see what I mean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I, no, I definitely understand. I also was agency before WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:40] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a common origin story, if you see what I mean. And yes, you&#8217;re absolutely right. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough in this release, WordPress 6.5, to be the Co-editor Tech Lead. Obviously alongside my colleague which is Riad Benguella. Some of you may know him. He is the lead architect of Gutenberg. So yeah, it&#8217;s been fantastic to work alongside him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, excellent. One of these days, I&#8217;m going to get Riad on here. I think I&#8217;ve never had him on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:05] <strong>Dave:</strong> Oh, you should definitely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> He&#8217;s so kind and reasonable. And I was just gonna tell a personal anecdote about Riad, and I don&#8217;t know that it makes any sense, but I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway. I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway. I saw him at an event like right after he came back from his most recent sabbatical, and he was like, it was great being away, but also like, I had forgotten what kind of energy events like this really bring in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he has always struck me as an introvert, but I think maybe he&#8217;s like an outgoing introvert or something. Cause normally, like, introvert introverts are not like, this gives me so much energy. They&#8217;re like, I know that this is important work, and I&#8217;m here. And so that&#8217;s my personal anecdote about Riad, I am, gonna get him on here someday, but be that as it may, we&#8217;re delighted to have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, 6.5 is coming out are you excited, number one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:54] <strong>Dave:</strong> I am very excited. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a long road into this release. As you may know, well, as you do know, it&#8217;s, it was delayed by one week. That was actually, I think was, was a good decision. We&#8217;ve had a lot of work needing to go into the Font Library feature. I&#8217;ve seen a few posts saying there were bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:09] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think mainly it was a decision about where to upload fonts to, which seems quite amazing when you think about it. I was talking to my wife about it the other day, and she said, really, you&#8217;re delaying a release because of where to upload things. But, yeah, this is software that runs a considerable part of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we make these decisions about where things uploaded, we&#8217;ve got to be really confident that they are the right decisions. And so, yeah, that decision to delay the release has been good. And we&#8217;ve had an opportunity to make sure the release is fully robust and ready to go out. So yeah, I&#8217;m super excited to see it land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I have some follow up questions about just like, how doing all of that work in public feels. But probably, we should get through the bulk of the sorts of things that people tune into this episode for, so like, let&#8217;s talk about some of the big features that are going into 6.5 so that folks have a sense for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;ll take a look at just like things that you&#8217;re excited to get in, things that I&#8217;m excited to get in. And maybe like if there&#8217;s a hidden surprise for users, things that will be really beneficial to users, but they don&#8217;t quite see it yet. We can maybe cover that too, but like, what are the big things going into this release from your perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:17] <strong>Dave:</strong> Sure. There&#8217;s some highlights, I think that the key highlights, and we should probably cover them. So the first one we&#8217;ve already touched on it is the Fonts Library. And this has been brewing for a while now, and it&#8217;s finally come to fruition. And it basically allows you to manage, install, and upload custom fonts for use on your website. And it&#8217;s really, really powerful. It&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s going to really change the way people create themes and create their websites. It is unlocking a lot of power for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And for folks who&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a long time, you have heard me say for, I think, like a year, basically every release podcast where we&#8217;re looking at what&#8217;s coming up. I&#8217;m like, and this time it&#8217;s fonts. I&#8217;m so excited. And so I&#8217;m saying it again this time, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s really happening this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Dave:</strong> It&#8217;s finally here. Yeah, it&#8217;s a great feature. There&#8217;s a lot of work gone into it. It&#8217;s really, really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So much work. We&#8217;ve been working on it for like two or three years. And it&#8217;s at the point where like getting it out in front of people is the only way to figure out where the remaining problems will be. And it is the most scary part of any software release, I assume, the things where you&#8217;re like, this is time for people to tell us how it&#8217;s broken. Please look at it and break it for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:29] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. We&#8217;ve been working on resolving any bugs that we could find, but there&#8217;s always going to be things we haven&#8217;t noticed. So yeah, we can&#8217;t wait for users to get their hands on it. Exactly. Other than fonts, we&#8217;ve also got revisions that are now in place in the Site Editor. And this is more than just undo, redo that people may be already familiar with in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually gives you the ability to fully revert your site back to any state that you previously had it. So you could make some changes in the editor. You could completely close down your computer, go away for a week, come back. And you&#8217;ve still got the opportunity to say, &#8220;Ah, do you know what? I don&#8217;t like the way that looks. I&#8217;m just gonna; I&#8217;m gonna roll that back.&#8221; And there&#8217;s a nice UI that shows you what it will affect. And you can even roll back styles, you know, like style changes. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s super, super powerful. And it&#8217;s just something we&#8217;ve been waiting for for such a long time. Just, it&#8217;s fantastic to see it land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m really excited about this one personally because I have been to so many meetup events with like new users being taught how to do things with WordPress. And invariably, in the last two or three years, the people who are presenting to new users are saying consistently like, &#8220;You can do any experimental thing that you feel like you need to do with your sites because there&#8217;s an undo button. WordPress wouldn&#8217;t let you do things that fully break your site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like there is a lot of trust in our kind of like time machine, roll-it-back kind of implementations. And so I&#8217;m really excited about this one. I think that for all of our new and mid-level users. Who like, have a little bit of fear, but mostly joy around it. Like, this will only increase that and so I&#8217;m super excited for this one to go in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:09] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really nice. Other than that, the two things I wanted to touch on as well, which is we&#8217;ve got these new views now for key objects in WordPress. So things like pages, patterns, templates, and template parts in the Site Editor. You can now view these in a sort of a table layout or in a grid layout. So it gives you a much easier way to sort them, find them, filter them. And I think it points us forward to the possibilities we&#8217;ve got in the future for the editor sort of taking some parts of WP Admin and making them more accessible without having to leave the Site Editor. And it&#8217;s extremely powerful; you can search in real-time, find things very, very quickly, do all the things you&#8217;re used to from the post listing screen, but all within the Site Editor. And it&#8217;s for these key objects that you use quite a lot of the time. So I think it&#8217;s going to be really, a really great thing for users to get hold of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Is this related to the Data Views work that we&#8217;ve been doing in the first part of the year here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Exactly that exactly. The Data Views work has been a major feed into this, and this is where we see the fruits of all that work coming to the fore for the first time. And I expect to see more of that in future releases as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. For folks who are really, really watching, like, our administrative side of things, you probably are aware that we, I don&#8217;t know, I wouldn&#8217;t say that we paused the phase three roadmap for this, but I do think that we made a clear choice to get this Data Views work done first so that we could, in parallel with phase three, do a bit of work on the WP Admin redesign, the dashboard redesign, which we all know, like, we love this dashboard, but also this dashboard, it needs a sprucing up, it needs a little bit of, of polish and a little bit of 2024 style I was going to say design. I don&#8217;t know if the design folks would love if I just was like, it needs to be modernized that way, but also like it, it does, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, and I mean, you know, we all know that the Site Editor is being used more and more. If you&#8217;ve got a Block theme, you&#8217;re using the Site Editor increasingly, and you&#8217;re spending less and less time sort of going between screens in WP Admin. So it makes sense that, you know, these things are accessible within that one interface of the Site Editor. So, yeah, it&#8217;s only going to be a good thing for users going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I probably should have like a whole episode about Data Views and what it&#8217;s intending to do, what it&#8217;s actually doing, what it&#8217;s going to look like as it goes because that&#8217;s such a big project. And so many things rely on it. And so, note to self and all listeners, that&#8217;s the thing that you should keep an eye out for. We&#8217;re going to get it done. But you said you had a final thing also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;ve got one more which is this is for our users of classic themes. We haven&#8217;t forgotten about you. Basically, we now have support for appearance tools. So in prior releases, the Block themes have got these really cool design tools like ability to set border colors, border radius, link colors, you name it. We&#8217;ve got all these tools, but they haven&#8217;t been always available to classic themes. And classic themes can use the Block Editor; they may not be using the Site Editor in the same way, but they can use the Block Editor. And we&#8217;ve not made those things available in the same way, but there&#8217;s been work going into this release to allow that to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:11] <strong>Dave:</strong> So now you can opt into those if you so wish. And it is an opt-in basis. So none your themes will break out of the box if you&#8217;ve got classic theme or classic site. But it is a powerful tool to those people who are using classic themes, and that&#8217;s completely legitimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so is the opt in like something that you can do for yourself or something that your developer needs to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:32] <strong>Dave:</strong> You would need to do it in your theme code. So you&#8217;d need to do that with PHP. So, your theme developer, if they choose to update their theme and provide support for these things. Then, they would obviously need to test their theme works with those new tools, make sure it&#8217;s ready, and then they would ship that update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so maybe after 6.5 is released, you may see some themes incrementally adding support. My understanding at the moment is that the core themes, the Block themes, will not automatically add those straight away. I think they need more time to allow them to bed in and more time to get them ready for prime time if you see what I mean, but you know the fact that they&#8217;re there and ready means that the wider theme audience and theme developers can start taking advantage of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Nice, nice. I have been wondering lately, this is only marginally related, but I&#8217;m gonna wonder it out loud anyway. I&#8217;ve been wondering lately if like, our classic themes, our most favorite, our most loved classic themes do need a little bit of help moving into a Block theme future. And I think that this will help. I think, on the one hand this will help, and on the other hand, like, what would it take for us to just say, and you&#8217;re not the theme person I know, but like, what would it take for us to just say, &#8220;These are our top five most favorite, most used, classic themes that we&#8217;ve got in WordPress. Let&#8217;s rebuild it in blocks and just ship the block version of it and help the classic themes users that love the design, love the look, love the features get introduced to this new block territory so that they can see that not only do they have the look, the feel, the features, but also the flexibility that comes with that and a little bit more feeling of safety as they wander around modifying themes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have no fear of any code changes and didn&#8217;t when I started working with WordPress, as opposed to working in WordPress, but I think that that&#8217;s not the way that that works right now. Like there&#8217;s a whole lot of like, I need to get it right-ish with folks who are using our software. And so I just wonder if that will help everybody feel a little more confident in what they&#8217;re doing, knowing they&#8217;re not going to break things because we&#8217;ve built it so you can&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:45] <strong>Dave:</strong> It could do, it could do. And I was just thinking as you were talking, like, do we have any themes that already do that? And, of course, we do have 2021. If you can think back that far into the mists of time, we had 2021 classic, which is that it&#8217;s called 2021, but we also 2021 blocks, which is doing very much what you&#8217;ve just described.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] <strong>Dave:</strong> So we haven&#8217;t pursued that for the new default themes or block themes, but, you know, it might be something to look at for onboarding if there are any of classic themes from the more distant past, you know, maybe some of those could do with a block theme equivalent just to let people on board to that experience and just feel comfortable. Yeah, interesting, interesting. You should definitely talk to the theme people about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m going to. They&#8217;re going to love it. They&#8217;re going to be like, Yay! Of course! Of course! I don&#8217;t know, actually. I don&#8217;t know if anyone ever loves the things that I suggest, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re not going to get suggested. I have all these ideas, and they got to come out somewhere. Okay. So do you have something that you worked on that&#8217;s not in this big list of features or that you helped people to really shepherd into the release that you think is really cool? Like, maybe it&#8217;s not going to be super visible or something, but like that you&#8217;ve personally felt was like a cool feature, excited for it to get into the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, there are a couple of things, a couple of things at the top of mind. One of them is user-facing and one of them is more developer-facing features. So, I&#8217;ll start with the developer feature first. And this one is a change to an API. Now, that API is always a slightly intimidating word, I think, but it just means a set of tools, a standardized set of tools that developers can use to do something. And in this case, it&#8217;s the allowed blocks API.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sounds so fun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:21] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I know it&#8217;s riveting, isn&#8217;t it? But trust me, it does come with some benefits. So the Navigation block is a good example. It&#8217;s a block that acts as a container and it&#8217;s got child blocks. Okay. But you can only insert certain blocks. You can insert links, you can insert social icons, you can insert search. But if you want to insert, I don&#8217;t know, an Icon block, for example. You can&#8217;t do that, but you can with WordPress 6.5 because of the change to the allow box API. And what it allows you to do is say, &#8220;I want to additionally allow the following blocks to be inserted as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as a developer, you can hook into this filter and change those blocks. Now, okay, so far, so good. &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221; you might say, well, it&#8217;s open the door, is open the door to some very, very interesting explorations. Some of which I&#8217;ve no doubt that you and your listeners would have already encountered. And one is by a colleague of mine called Nick Diego. And I think it&#8217;s on the WordPress Developer blog right now. I think he&#8217;s done a fantastic inspiration into mega menus in the navigation block. I&#8217;m someone who&#8217;s worked on the Navigation block extensively in the past, and I&#8217;m very aware of how much users want mega menus to be a part of the Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Dave:</strong> I was never convinced it was going to be something we were going to do in core, because it requires so many different things. But Nick has actually managed with this allow blocks API and some other tweaks as well to build a mega menu as a plugin for WordPress using the standard Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s just one example of the utility of this API. But for example, I mentioned that you could add icons to your Navigation block and you can&#8217;t really do that at the moment. It&#8217;s pretty powerful. It&#8217;s kind of hidden away. It&#8217;s in the release notes, but it&#8217;s not massively clear, but it does open some pretty big doors. And I think if you&#8217;re a developer or a theme author, indeed, you should you should definitely be looking into that and see what it enables for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ll put a link to Nick&#8217;s post in the show notes, and we&#8217;ll share it around the social spaces. So like, I hear you saying it&#8217;s buried, it&#8217;s hard to see, it won&#8217;t necessarily be exciting now, but will be exciting later, but like mega menus and sliders, those are the most contested things that people want to put on sites all the time. Like from my agency days, like when I was thinking in the mindset of a strategist, a data person, that&#8217;s what I was doing. Like, I never wanted sliders. I never wanted mega menus because it just implied that we didn&#8217;t have a decision about the sites we were making, like we had not decided the primary purpose, and also it was just hard to track, but it was always literally every single time people are like well if Amazon has it why can&#8217;t we have it? You&#8217;re like, yeah, I know, but they&#8217;re Amazon. They&#8217;re not the same like mega menus sliders. I know that from a project perspective that we&#8217;re like, that should be a theme thing. That should be in theme territory. But I think it makes sense to have in core because so many people want to be able to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just because like someone like me feels like it&#8217;s not the right call for your business doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t be able to make that decision for yourself, you know, I think that&#8217;s a, I think that&#8217;s a great, a great feature to call out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I completely agree. I can look for my agency days. I can exactly imagine that sort of thing. We have a lot of people, a problem that a lot of people are facing. So it&#8217;s really important that we provide the tools to allow people to do that now. And we can always look at if it&#8217;s valid to include it in core later, then we can look at that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the first one I had. The second one is a little bit more user-facing. I would say it&#8217;s hidden away. But I&#8217;m not 100 percent sure it is. I mean, Josepha, how often do you create links when you&#8217;re working with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like every time that I&#8217;m in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Same here. I do it all the time, right? And a lot of people do. And for a long while, contributors to the editor have been sort of collecting and collating the feedback that&#8217;s come in from people about their frustrations with the built in link interface in the Block Editor. So if you&#8217;re creating a hyperlink to, you know, hyperlink to another page or, you know, you&#8217;re going to link to Nick&#8217;s mega menu article, you&#8217;re going to be doing that a lot, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that people do when they&#8217;re creating content in WordPress. And so we worked a lot to refine that with a contributor who, who you may know, Rich Tabor. Who&#8217;s also, I think, on the release squad as well. An influencer in the WordPress space as well. He spent a lot of time looking at the UX and myself and a number of other contributors have spent a lot of time in this release refining that. And I think it&#8217;s surprisingly difficult to get right, but I think we&#8217;ve, I think we&#8217;ve made some nice improvements to that will be nice quality of life for people who, to do this sort of content creation quite a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s things like now when you create the link for the first time, it remains open on the initial creation of the link. So that means you can quickly then easily adjust the link. I mean, it seems obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? Yeah, but it&#8217;s not happening. It just used to just automatically close, and the people are like, &#8220;Hey, I wanted to make more adjustments.&nbsp;&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I wasn&#8217;t done yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:10] <strong>Dave:</strong> Exactly. Yeah, exactly. We&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve streamlined the UI. We&#8217;ve removed a lot of clutter, but we&#8217;ve also added some useful tools, like ability to copy a link and remove the link directly from the control itself. And lastly along with lots of other accessibility changes in this release. We have worked a lot on refining the implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is discoverable for, for users of assistive tech because we spent a lot of time talking to core accessibility team and other people, and they were finding it very hard to perceive that the UI was there because of the way that keyboard interactions work and you&#8217;ve got the block toolbar in the way and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We think we&#8217;ve nailed on a really good solution now that works for, not only uses assistive tech, but actually provides benefits for sighted users as well. It&#8217;s kind of difficult to talk about. I mean, I have got a video covering this on my YouTube channel, which kind of shows it in a bit more detail, but we&#8217;re happy it&#8217;s in a much better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:02] <strong>Dave:</strong> And yeah if people have got feedback about it, and when, when 6.5 comes out, we&#8217;re always happy to hear that. And you can go to the WordPress GitHub repository and raise an issue. And one of us will jump on it and see what we can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And we can include a link to that video also. So like, for folks where this sounded intriguing, but they don&#8217;t quite get the concept, like video content all day, let&#8217;s pop it into our show notes. And everybody can take a look at it there. I think that&#8217;s a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> Great. Yeah, I appreciate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So final question, maybe, maybe final question, final planned question. Is there anything from a user-facing perspective again that you feel has not really gotten the airtime that it needs so far?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:44] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think there&#8217;s a lot of technical changes that have happened in this release. So it&#8217;s easy to look at those. I mean, we&#8217;ve covered quite a lot of the key ones that will be user-facing in terms of Font Library and Revisions. We&#8217;ve got things that are going to this release that enable things a lot for people to experience in the future, I think, so underlying changes like the Interactivity API becoming public. Now that&#8217;s public, plugin developers can start to make sites much more interactive on the front of the site rather than just in the editor. So I think that once 6.5 has gone in, and people have started to explore the Interactivity API in more detail, we might see more plugins offering sort of interactivity on the fronts of their sites. An example is obviously the lightbox you&#8217;ve got with images in core, but I can; there&#8217;s way more stuff that you can do with that. So we&#8217;re going to see more of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> We&#8217;ve got Block Hooks that have landed in 6.5, and this is going to open for things like ecommerce plugins and to be able to add, you know, cart blocks or log in, log out blocks to things like navigation, for example, or you might want a ability to like all your comments, and you can do that with Block Hooks and then a plugin developer can just, you know, when the plugin is enabled, they can just make it so that those things just appear on your site, but you still got control over the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot of like hidden things I think are going to uncover new features for users over time as a result of the community getting involved and changing their plugins and themes to do these take advantage of these new tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, so the Interactivity API, obviously it has &#8220;API&#8221; on it. And so no one&#8217;s thinking, well, this is a user-facing thing. And while the API is not a user facing thing, like, I think that you&#8217;re right. That what it enables absolutely is going to be really useful and hopefully really engaging for like end-to-end users, like the users that are not listening to this podcast and they don&#8217;t know we exist, like they don&#8217;t know that WordPress has a community building it, they&#8217;re just like, it exists, there&#8217;s a software that came out of nowhere, like, I&#8217;m really excited to see how our developers in the community start to use that in their plugins and themes and get that out to end users. I&#8217;m really, really excited to see how creative they get with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you have a final thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:51] <strong>Dave:</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of design changes, I think. I mean, we can&#8217;t cover them all, obviously, in verbal form in this podcast, but some things that are just standing out to me if we look at the source of truth for, for WordPress 6.5, it is, it is big. There&#8217;s a lot in this release. But there&#8217;s some very cool things for, I don&#8217;t know, quality. I like to see them as like quality of life design design changes. Things like, if you drop an image, as a background image of a cover block, it automatically sets the overlay color for that cover block to match the most prominent color of the background image. Like things like that, they seem small, but over time, they just, you just drop that thing, and it just does it. And it&#8217;s like, this is nice. And it feels like a nice tool to use that just is intuitive. And I think there&#8217;s, we&#8217;ll see a lot of those things landing in this release that can just make the experience of working with WordPress and working in the Site Editor much, much nicer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I remember when I first ran into that particular thing, it was on the Showcase, our most recent redesign of it. We&#8217;re using that functionality in there before it was available in core. Obviously, I know, but it was really fascinating. I&#8217;m not great with color combinations. Like, I don&#8217;t have a sense for, like, oh, that&#8217;s the primary thing. That&#8217;s not. And so having that being done kind of automatically so that my stuff looks good anyway, despite what my color sense said to do or not. I thought it was great. Makes you look good as somebody who&#8217;s running a business. You don&#8217;t have to know how things work in order to have excellently functional, really beautiful things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I think that&#8217;s a great thing about all of our releases. Obviously, everything is supposed to work that way, but like this one has a lot of really cool things like that available. I think those are really the questions that I had. Is there anything you want to make sure to share before we kind of give last thoughts and head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:39] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I was, I was thinking a lot about, you know, the community we&#8217;ve got with WordPress, and I think that people outside of WordPress may not really understand that how amazing this community is that we&#8217;ve got here, but I wanted to say to people like don&#8217;t shy away from contributing to WordPress. I get that, you know, people like myself are fortunate enough to be sponsored to do it. But there&#8217;s always something that people can do, even if that&#8217;s just spending like 30 minutes testing a release or donating some of your time to run one of the meetings. It can really make a difference overall. Even just filing a bug report for something you see in WordPress 6.5 or testing 6.5 before it goes out, those little things do make a big difference. And if you&#8217;re not sure where to go, then we can signpost you with links, no doubt in this, in the podcast description with where where&#8217;s to go. But yeah, I just want to encourage people to get involved, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. And it&#8217;s all working out in public, like we&#8217;ve got developers, designers, marketing folks, community folks like all doing this work out where everybody can see it. And so that, I know, can look really kind of overwhelming. But I want to just highlight, like, you don&#8217;t have to know everything about what&#8217;s happening in the project in order to get involved in the project. Like every small bit of contribution toward like finding a new bug or confirming that a bug happens across other devices, other setups, things like that, like those all help make things better and keep things moving as quickly as we are able to make them move. And so, yeah, I&#8217;ll second that every little thing that you think like that won&#8217;t make a difference. It does. We can&#8217;t tell that things are broken or things are working or things are in need of some care unless you highlight those for us. And this is the best way to do it is to show up and give 30 minutes to send out a group testing invite to your meetup group or whatever it is that you all have been thinking you should do, like, this is your sign. You can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:34] <strong>Dave:</strong> Everyone should get involved if they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I agree. I agree. Dave, this has been such an excellent conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:42] <strong>Dave:</strong> Oh, thank you very much. It&#8217;s a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:43] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> What an interesting release we&#8217;ve got coming out this week. I&#8217;m so glad you all made it this far in the pod, and now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First up, following up on the WordPress meetup reactivation project that we had in 2022, we aim to revive some meetup groups in big cities that are inactive or help the local WordPress community that are not yet part of our meetup chapter program to join our program. There is a post out on the community P2 on the community site. That is titled Asia Meetup Revival Project 2024. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that in the show notes if you want to read more about that and figure out how to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of getting involved, we have roughly a million meetings. Because it&#8217;s a new month, we&#8217;re in April now. New month, new opportunities. There are a lot of things happening in April. We will be coming out of a major release, obviously, and so there will be some minor release follow up to do. There will be a lot of discussion about what&#8217;s coming next, what&#8217;s in trunk, what&#8217;s not in trunk. But also a lot of work being done around our next big major events, our next big major training initiatives. There&#8217;s just so much happening. Spring is a time when we are looking at stuff that&#8217;s new, what we want to invest in, what we want to grow. And so if you have not attended one in a while or even at all if you&#8217;ve never attended a meeting in the community, then this is a great time to start and join your fellow community members trying to make WordPress better every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on our small list of big things is I am looking at helping to shift the focus of our WordPress marketing community. We&#8217;ve had a bit of a struggle over the years to figure out what our primary focus and our primary impact can be. So there&#8217;s a post up called &#8216;Making a WordPress Media Corps&#8217;. It&#8217;s gotten quite a bit of attention, and I do really think that it has a lot of potential for solving some of the issues that we have and kind of getting some quick wins into our recent history of that team so that we can move forward confidently together. So pop on over, give it a read, share your thoughts. And if you are one of these qualified media partners, also let us know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

It simplifies the process, with fewer dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance. Use it to create memorable user experiences, like fetching search results instantly or letting visitors interact with content in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connect blocks to custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Link core block attributes to custom fields and use the value of custom fields without creating custom blocks. Powered by the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/06/new-feature-the-block-bindings-api/\">Block Bindings API</a>, developers can extend this capability further to connect blocks to any dynamic content—even beyond custom fields. If there’s data stored elsewhere, easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add appearance tools to Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Give designers and creators using Classic themes access to an upgraded design experience. Opt in to support for spacing, border, typography, and color options, even without using theme.json. Once support is enabled, more tools will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Explore improvements to the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s now an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/\">easier way to manage plugin dependencies</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs, presenting users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From fast to faster: Performance updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes 110+ performance updates, resulting in an impressive increase in speed and efficiency across the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed up to five times faster than the previous release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Translated sites see up to 25% improvement in load time for this release courtesy of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/27/i18n-improvements-6-5-performant-translations/\">Performant Translations</a>. Additional performance highlights include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/23/wordpress-6-5-adds-avif-support/\">AVIF image support</a> and improvements for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/29/performance-improvements-for-registering-block-variations-with-callbacks/\">registering block variations with callbacks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A tradition of inclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes more than 65 accessibility improvements across the platform, making it more accessible than ever. It contains an important fix that unblocks access to the admin submenus for screen reader users and others who navigate by keyboard. This release also adds fixes to color contrast in admin focus states, positioning of elements, and cursor focus, among many others, that help improve the WordPress experience for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn more about WordPress 6.5</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-5/\">WordPress 6.5 page</a>&nbsp;to learn more about the numerous enhancements and features of this release—including short demos of some of the highlighted features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explore <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> for quick how-to videos, <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/social-learning/\">online workshops</a>, and other free resources to level up your WordPress knowledge and skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/15/wordpress-6-5-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.5 Field Guide</a> for detailed technical information and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes-6-5/\">developer notes</a> to help you build with WordPress and get the most out of this release.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> I have returned from WordCamp Asia and struggled my way through some truly aggressive jet lag, so that means it&#8217;s time for a little WordCamp wrap-up. I spoke with a couple hundred people at the event, and I came away with a few topics that seemed to be on everyone&#8217;s minds. Those topics are: making business in WordPress, the business of making WordPress, and how to communicate both sides a little better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So first, let&#8217;s start with making business in WordPress. This comes up at every event, and that honestly just makes sense. WordPress is a tool that people use to power their businesses across our global economy, and sometimes the businesses are closely related to WordPress itself. They are creating custom themes or plugins, building WordPress powered commerce sites for clients, or offering any number of agency services. But there are also businesses that are a little less close: restaurants, museums, local governments, schools. But it was clear that they all rely on the software just as much as the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it was nice to see some sessions that focused specifically on business matters in WordPress. And I heard so many people tell me about a conversation they had had earlier in the day with someone who helped them figure out their pricing or advised them on early errors they made in their business journey and generally helped them feel a little less lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always love seeing this. Hearing how people are accomplishing their goals because of connections they made at one of our events, it&#8217;s enough to keep me coming back for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that came up a lot was the business of making WordPress. I don&#8217;t know if that came up a lot because of the sorts of conversations that people are willing to bring to me these days or because there was overwhelming interest in knowing how we keep all these trains on their tracks. But either way, it was refreshing to be able to have so many conversations about the invisible work that goes into a project like this. There was a Contributor Day that hosted over 600 people, if I recall correctly, which makes it the largest Contributor Day in the area to date. 35 percent of those people had never attended a Contributor Day before, so there were a lot of people who were discovering the WordPress community for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for folks who&#8217;ve been here for a long time, it&#8217;s so easy for us to forget how much there is to learn at first. Even if you happen to show up with a skill set that fits a contributor team&#8217;s needs exactly, you still have to learn where we collaborate, how distributed contribution works, and all these rules and guidelines about open source freedoms and copyleft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:10] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> And then also you have to come to terms with the fact that we define and design all of our spaces and programs with belonging in mind. I mean, for every one question that you get answered, there are going to be six new ones that you didn&#8217;t know you had yet. So I came away from a lot of these conversations with the reminder that it&#8217;s important in so many ways for us to talk about the work that we do, even when it&#8217;s boring, even when we think it doesn&#8217;t really matter, because a lot of people have questions about how this works, how it runs, and how they can be part of making sure that it&#8217;s around for the long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing that came up all over the place last week was how to communicate these things better. It&#8217;s easy to forget that folks who listen to this podcast don&#8217;t actually make up like a hundred percent of the people using WordPress; that&#8217;s on me. So just cause I&#8217;ve said here that, you know, enterprise is our next big space for biz dev or that, our primary growth markets are APAC, or that events are our best tool for brand expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> Like, just because I said it doesn&#8217;t mean that everyone heard it. And we absolutely have to get those messages to more people, more frequently, and with more certainty. You&#8217;ll hear often from WordPress pundits that rising tides lift all boats, and the bigger the pie, the more the slices. We believe fully in the spirit of coopetition here, that we are all better together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that we&#8217;re mostly just talking to ourselves about it. It&#8217;s hard to get outside our own little bubble, but I believe completely that doing so is the best thing for our project in the long term. Not only so that we can continue to grow and provide access to the opportunities we know we offer but also so that we can do more to dignify our profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developers are not taken seriously, and yet you all are some of the smartest and most compassionate people I&#8217;ve ever met in my career. And I&#8217;d like to see how we can fix that perception together. And so that&#8217;s it. Those are the big, big, giant, old topics that came up a lot in conversation last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:14] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget that you can catch up on all the sessions via the live stream, or if you are feeling inspired to contribute, reach out to the community team and see what sorts of meetup events you can host.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:32] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things. I have two big things and one slightly less big thing, but they&#8217;re all fairly big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the first thing on the list is that the latest version of WordPress, WordPress 6.5, is on target for release on March 26th. That&#8217;s, I think, a couple weeks from now. So keep an eye out for that. In the event, I mean, we have auto-updates everywhere, and probably you are on a WordPress-specific host and, so you won&#8217;t necessarily need to do anything. But if you have any desire or concerns about seeing the software a little bit ahead of time, you can always go and download the beta, give it a quick test or the release candidate, give that a quick test. See if there&#8217;s anything that&#8217;s not functioning as you expected it to function, and let us know if it&#8217;s not. But yeah, there are auto-updates. You don&#8217;t have to go out and proactively do anything if you don&#8217;t want to, that&#8217;s just in case you do want to. That&#8217;s coming up March 26th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> The next thing is that I want to give everybody a general call-in for event contribution. So, WordPress events is where I entered the community. It is one of the most affirming and life-changing types of contribution I&#8217;ve ever done because you get to see a bunch of people succeed in their own goals because of something that you were able to tell them. It&#8217;s like teaching, but with people who elected to be there. So we have a lot of opportunities, for contribution by volunteering at events, either as volunteering at the event itself or to volunteer to organize it. We have small-scale, easy-to-do meetups, but we also have slightly larger WordCamps that can be done. If you have any hope for doing that or are just kind of interested. I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:19] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> And then the final thing on here is that we actually have a pretty substantial proposal out at the moment. It&#8217;s for non-editable footers on all event website pages. This might not sound interesting to you, but it actually is kind of interesting. So, it&#8217;s been proposed to add a non-editable footer to all of the event website pages moving forward. So that&#8217;s everything that would be displayed on a WordCamp or on any of the new formatted event sites that we have. This proposal intends to meet two goals. One, it fills any legal requirements a site or country might have about displaying the privacy policy and other items. And two, it brings visibility to the new events.WordPress.org website, where a community member can find more events in their area.&nbsp;The last day to respond to that proposal is March 20th, which I think is two days from now. I think it&#8217;s on Wednesday and this is airing on Monday. So, I&#8217;ll have a link to that in the show notes as well in case you have any thoughts about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:15] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

Here, you’ll learn all authentication protocols, their main functionalities, and how they can impact your business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end, you’ll know how to choose the best protocol for your specific use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are authentication protocols, and why do they matter?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Authentication protocols are network security rules determining how individuals or systems verify their identities during online communications. They are like online bouncers, checking IDs before letting anyone in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These protocols are the first defense against unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive information doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. This can prevent data breaches, substantial financial losses, and reputation damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From traditional password-based methods to cutting-edge biometric verification, authentication protocols follow three main steps:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Identification</strong>, where the user claims an identity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authentication</strong>, where they prove their identity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authorization</strong>, where they get access to resources.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Encryption and decryption are at the heart of these protocols, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data being exchanged.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress 6.6, WordPress 6.5.3, Gutenberg 18.1 and 18.2, and the create block theme updates. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor to the WordPress Open Source project, sponsored by Automattic&#8217;s Five for the Future program. I&#8217;m so happy that Sarah Norris joins us again today. Some of you already know her as she has been a guest on the show before. Sarah is a core contributor on the Gutenberg project, also sponsored by Automattic, and this year&#8217;s core team rep, together with Joe McGill. Sarah, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> I&#8217;m good, thank you. Yeah, I&#8217;m doing really well. I&#8217;m celebrating a few recent releases at the moment. We got the font library has just come out in 6.5. I was working closely with some of the other contributors to that. Then we&#8217;ve also got a brand-new revamped Create Block Theme plugin, a few releases, we&#8217;re probably going to talk about them. Also, celebrating a couple of releases there as well. I&#8217;m also looking forward to this year&#8217;s WordCamp Europe. Really looking forward to some of the talks. We&#8217;ve got talks about playground, the interactivity API. There&#8217;s quite a few talks about block themes as well, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>WordCamp Europe has quite a great schedule, and if you haven&#8217;t checked it out, dear listeners, do so now because it also will be live-streamed. If you are interested in Block Editor and you&#8217;re listening, so I am assuming you are, you will see quite a few great talks. As Sarah said, playground, interactivity, API. It&#8217;s also HTML API workshop. I don&#8217;t know if that will be live-streamed, but Dennis Snell is the programmer of it and he&#8217;s also a great teacher and educator, so I&#8217;m looking forward to his workshop. These are exciting times in WordPress innovation and tooling. I just got back from WordCamp Leipzig and people are excited about the new revamped Create Block Theme plugin, and I came back on the Monday and on Tuesday, I think you released a new version, so everything that I showed had a different interface now, but I think it made it so much clearer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people are excited about that because that&#8217;s a no-code way to create themes, that&#8217;s we&#8217;ll talk about in a few minutes, and they&#8217;re also very excited about the upcoming grid layouts that are coming to Gutenberg also in July to WordPress 6.6. WordCamp Leipzig also was a full-German WordCamp, which is always a little bit unusual for me because I&#8217;m doing technical stuff mostly in English. I&#8217;m really happy to catch up with the German webcam community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear listeners, as you notice, we took a break in April, but we are back in full force. Before we head into the vastness of the Block Editor and WordPress happenings, I wanted to alert you to the next Developer Hours on Tuesday, May 14th, 2024 at 1500 UTC, that&#8217;s 9:00 AM Eastern Daylight, and you hear my hesitation. Time zones are the bane of my existence, so double check it, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a very important Developer Hours. Nick Diego and Ryan Welcher will show plugin developers and those who have used Meta boxes before. It&#8217;s kind of a legacy feature, but it has been around for a long time to manage custom fields, and while Meta boxes are supported in the Block Editor, they&#8217;re considered legacy and do not provide an ideal user experience that we came to know. Then since the session, Nick and Ryan will explore current options available to custom plugin developers and theme settings in the Block Editor, so you can manage metadata using React and native WordPress components. You will learn how to use the slots in the sidebar and implement a model for additional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Settings, fetch and save post metadata using JavaScript and also, connect post metadata to blocks. There are multiple ways to do this now in the Block Editor. By the end of the session, they will have an open discussion about the blockers, what prevents developers from migrating away from Meta boxes and possible solutions. It&#8217;s a great session for whoever is still, and there are many, many people who are still working with plugins that are using Meta boxes for their data. I think this is the start of a movement away from it. It also is a good place to gather the feedback what is actually a blocker, so it can be resolved in the Block Editor. May 14th, 2024 at 1500 UTC. All right, do you have any thoughts on this or ideas?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> I mean, it sounds amazing. I think whenever there&#8217;s so many options, there often is with WordPress how to do something or just coding in general. It&#8217;s always good to go through them and find other people&#8217;s thoughts and maybe you hear a better idea on how you are doing it, but yeah, especially with custom Meta boxes. That&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> There&#8217;s also been a GitHub issue or PR that the Meta boxes that are now on the bottom of the screen will be moved into a modal that is you have to click it to open it up from the top toolbar, and that way, now the post editor can also be loaded in the iframe and then have a better user experience and can better be styled and all that. The Meta boxes are a little bit one step away from the first screen, which is also good because the initial experience of having an empty post and then some gray boxes underneath is not a very intuitive interface either. I think with that PR also have been around for a while and discussed. I will link to it also in the show notes so you have the full context about things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be a shift because most of it is from PHP to JavaScript and that shift has not been easy for a lot of developers, including me. I learned JavaScript the third time now and I&#8217;m still not proficient. I learned the first time JavaScript was in 2023 when I was building my own static, my own static page builder. Not 2023, no, 2003, so it was one of the early JavaScript and it was a hell to go through.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, so let&#8217;s go to our community contribution section. I&#8217;m just giving a shout-out to Anne McCarthy who put together a high-level demonstration of WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Playground has been the most surprising tool of 2023 for a lot of people, including me, and I have fallen in love with it because it is a tool without having a server, without needing to install PHP or SQL Server or something like that. You have a link and you can install, pre-install a plugin that you can then preview and you don&#8217;t have to set up anything. Once you close your browser, it&#8217;s all gone. It&#8217;s in the ether, but you could, if you wanted to, have a storage option there. Anne McCarthy shows you what else can be done with Playground. The YouTube video will be in the show notes, of course. It also gives me great pleasure to give you all a sneak preview or sneak knowledge, pre-knowledge about the upcoming Blueprint community project. What are Blueprints?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blueprints are the configuration files for Playground where you can use WPCLI, you can use import content, you can use PHP to pre-configure the Playground instance that you link to. Right now, there&#8217;s a gallery, a pre-version one gallery of 10 Blueprints. The community project is that whoever uses Playground can share their Blueprints with the world so other people can use it too and adopt it to their needs for their projects. It was great to figure that out and put this together. I think we will start later this month to make public announcements, but you can check it out and maybe check out some of those Blueprints already.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create Block Theme Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you worked with Create Block Theme plugin preview. How&#8217;s that going? Do you get any numbers or so? How many people click on that link?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris</em>: Actually, I haven&#8217;t checked. That sounds something to see how many people are using it. I know we&#8217;ve got great feedback about it and I think just in general, it&#8217;s a really good tool to preview plugins before you install it on your site, especially if you&#8217;re looking for a specific functionality from a plugin for a single website rather than something that&#8217;s going to be used everywhere, like all websites. It&#8217;s a great way to preview changes. I&#8217;ve not seen this Blueprint gallery before as well. This is a great idea too. Recently for the Automattic themes repo, we&#8217;ve added a Playground theme previewer, so that fits into this, like the theme tester Blueprint. A good example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think there are a few kinks to work out, and I know that Adam Zielinski and his team are really working quite a bit on making things better. One kink is that when you upload, so you prepare the code, the content that you want to share with a Blueprint or with a Playground or template, a theme demo or so, you prepare the content in the Block Editor. You can export it normally with the WordPress export feature, but when you use it in a Blueprint, the images won&#8217;t come through, so you need to upload the images to a space where Blueprint has access to. I think the team is working on how to resolve that or make it a better experience. One of the theme testing Blueprints has that problem that the images point to a site that doesn&#8217;t have cross-site allowances problem, the course problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still a few kinks to work out. There&#8217;s one Blueprint in there where you can use WPCLI and add an attachment to a post, but then you need to upload that image beforehand. It&#8217;s an interesting conundrum, or how to solve it. The whole Blueprint features steps that you can automatically log in, you can automatically install plugins as many as you need. You can install a certain theme, you can upload some content. I actually use the WPCLI to add 12 posts automatically, so a query block has some content in there and not just the hello world. There are quite a few things that you can make those previews or testings a little bit more refined so you don&#8217;t have to have so much set up for some things, so it&#8217;s good. Yes, Create Block Theme updates, well, you brought it, brought some updates here to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> We&#8217;ve had a lot of updates on this, yes, Birgit. We&#8217;re trying to keep up with Gutenberg, maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, join the club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> We&#8217;ve recently released the 2.1 version and then we&#8217;ve had a few point minor releases after that as well. We&#8217;re currently up to 2.1.3. Basically, the latest changes are a big revamp of the UI with an intentional move from the WP admin pages to the panel in the editor. I think for a while we&#8217;ve had a Create Block Theme. It uses a little spanner icon in the top right of the editor, so we&#8217;re trying to move a lot more of the options to that panel. Instead of having to jump between the WP admin pages and the editor, you should be able to stay in the editor for most of the tooling. We&#8217;ve also added a lot more options for how a theme is saved before it&#8217;s exported and there&#8217;s a lot more control, giving users a lot more control over how the theme is saved as well. Because previously, Create Block Theme was doing magic behind the scenes and it wasn&#8217;t obvious what was going on. We&#8217;ve tried to surface that a little bit better and it makes it more clear what&#8217;s happening to the theme export before you start importing it to other places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Before we dive in into the details, for somebody who hasn&#8217;t heard about the plugin yet, the Create Block Theme plugin, what does it actually do? What is it for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> It&#8217;s to fill a gap basically between creating themes in the editor, which is obviously already really good and improves almost by the hour, too many updates, but most of the editor changes are very centric to the editor and therefore, to the single instance of the site that you&#8217;re working on. Create Block Theme tries to fill a gap where you&#8217;re making changes in the editor, and then it lets you export those changes so you can import them to either a standalone theme, so you can then do whatever you want with that, either make it open source, have it as a proprietary product. Any options that you can have for any other theme, but it lets you do it all from within the editor and hopefully, makes just theming in general a lot easier for no-code. We&#8217;ve tried to, because the people who work on it generally used to coding themes as well, we tried to make it friendly for both people who like to code and no-code as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The workflow to create a theme would be to install a theme, preferably Twenty Twenty Four, but any block theme would do, make your changes and then decide if you want to have a child theme of that or a clone of that theme that has no connection to the parent theme, and put the changes that you make in the Global Styles, like the colors and the topography and the dimensions, and any of that changes. When a user makes them in the Block Editor, in the Site Editor, they&#8217;re stored in the database, so they&#8217;re not getting into the files. Like the template files, if you create a new template, it&#8217;s stored in the database. If you add new custom colors, they&#8217;re stored in the database. When you choose the Create Block Theme, everything of those changes that you made in the editor will be replicated or duplicated in the files for a new theme or whatever theme you decide to do. Is that correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly it. I guess a quick way to sum it up would be instead of having user changes, it elevates those changes to the theme level and then you can do whatever you would normally like to do with a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I did a test of a few things, and I really enjoyed starting from a blank theme, which is not entirely blank. You get the theme JSON and you get the index HTML and you get whatever you need for a fully functioning theme. It&#8217;s just not a styled line, and then you can add your colors and your typography and upload the fonts. What are the things that are now in the new UI that you can decide on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> The main differences are how you save the changes to your active theme. Previously, you could just save all the changes and it&#8217;d just be like one option and you didn&#8217;t really know how things were being saved, and then you could export and you could do a one-click save and export as well, so it bundled loads of functionality into one button. With the new changes and the new UI, we&#8217;ve tried to break those out a lot more, so it gives you more control over how the theme is being saved, and then you can choose what&#8217;s exported as well. The things that we&#8217;ve separated out are fonts, so there&#8217;s now a save fonts option, so that lets you opt into including any installed fonts, and it also will delete any deactivated fonts from the current theme as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the new font library basically as well with a new theme to install those fonts, and then you have more options on how they&#8217;re included in the theme. You also can optionally include your Global Styles changes. Like we&#8217;ve just been talking about, they were automatically being saved, so from the database into the theme level. You probably will want to do that for all changes, but now this is optional as well. In case you&#8217;ve made some changes maybe to test things out, or maybe you were testing out some typography and some colors and then you don&#8217;t like them, you cannot save them to your theme if you don&#8217;t want to do that. There&#8217;s also, we&#8217;ve separated out saving any template changes. This means any block edits or block markup changes that you make to templates will be included by default, but you can optionally not include them as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> It just gives you more control. Again, if you&#8217;ve just been testing something, you might not want to include it in your theme, but probably likely you&#8217;ve been changing it to update the theme. Probably most of the time you will want to include the changes. We&#8217;ve also made it optional to disallow Create Block Theme from editing any existing templates to say you&#8217;ve cloned a theme that already includes a bunch of templates and you really like the way they&#8217;re set up. Maybe the text is already translatable, and this might be good if you&#8217;ve edited block markup in the templates manually. Maybe if you&#8217;re making the indentation look nice, anything like that, we&#8217;ve now got an option that Create Block Theme will only process. Processes like making text translatable or localizing images, it will only process the templates that you&#8217;ve edited within the editor and it will leave any previous templates that came with the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we&#8217;ve also got a few other smaller things that are turned off by default because we found that most people probably want them off by default. These are making text strings translatable. Again, Create Block Theme used to do this for everything, so now it&#8217;s optional, so in case you don&#8217;t want that happening. It will also move any image assets. If you&#8217;ve uploaded images to templates, there&#8217;s an option to include these images in the theme assets folder and change the URL to be relative to the theme. That&#8217;s optional as well. If you turn that off, it won&#8217;t move any images and it&#8217;ll just leave them local instead of on the theme. Then the final one, which I think is probably the smallest change, but it is a major one, is optionally removing the ref attribute from the navigation book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ref attribute is important because it references a specific menu, but because the specific menu is local to the site instance, when you export a theme, that&#8217;s not going to exist on every site. We did explore doing this for every single navigation block, but obviously, not everyone&#8217;s exporting a theme. Some people just want to save a theme, and then they&#8217;ve got a collection of local themes that they use. It&#8217;s not always applicable, and it can mean that it visually looks like you&#8217;ve lost an entire menu when all of this happens. It&#8217;s just lost its reference to the existing menu. Alternatively to that, if you are exporting a theme and you want to distribute it on the theme directory or anywhere else, you probably don&#8217;t want to reference a menu that doesn&#8217;t exist anywhere else. It maybe sounds confusing if you don&#8217;t know the block markup for the navigation block. If you do, you probably, well, hopefully, when you see the option, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I do want to do that please remove over.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It doesn&#8217;t assume things that are there that are not there, and then it&#8217;s not a good experience for a new user of a theme. Yeah, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris</em>: Yeah, makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Totally makes sense. How are Patterns actually treated in the Create Block Theme?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> For pattern management, that&#8217;s like the next thing we&#8217;re looking at because it&#8217;s a bigger beast to tackle, and interesting how it&#8217;s going to work with the changes in 6.6, but we can talk about those later, maybe. Currently, the main interaction with Patterns at the moment is that with the options, I&#8217;ve just gone through, the save options, with making text translatable and moving the image assets into the theme assets folder. Both of those things currently require PHP. Probably if you&#8217;ve been using the editor to make any changes and haven&#8217;t jumped into the code, everything is going to be in HTML. Create Block Theme will move these references into a PHP file, which is by creating a pattern. Because that&#8217;s currently the only way or one of the best ways, I guess, to make text translatable and to reference image assets from the theme director. That&#8217;s currently the only interaction with Patterns at the moment. We are hoping to maybe introduce pattern management, or at least iteratively make the pattern management experience better when using Gutenberg. That&#8217;s our hope anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Patterns have been around for a long time. Well, it&#8217;s not the Patterns that were around for a long time, it&#8217;s a reusable block that can be used as a template part, for instance, and it&#8217;s now called Sync Pattern. They had its own import export feature in WordPress or still have that you can import Patterns via JSON where you can copy paste them from the pattern directory. There are many different ways to get to Patterns, so having one feature in Create Block plugin, that&#8217;s going to be a complex piece to tackle. Yeah, definitely. They also have the references to the original Patterns when you have the synced overrides. That&#8217;s something we are going to talk about. It&#8217;s going to be real complex. What I also like is that you can update the metadata of your new theme within the sidebar with a plugin, so you can change the name of it and you can change the description and do it all right there, so you really don&#8217;t have to touch code for that. That is a really good thing. What else? Oh, yes. Yeah, what else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Like you said, we&#8217;ve got a new metadata editor within the editor. You can now open a modal, I guess similar to the custom method fields. It just means, again, all the information goes into the readme.txt file, so probably anyone who&#8217;s editing that information already is familiar with editing the read me, but it just means that you don&#8217;t need to jump into your code editor and you can stay in the WordPress editor. Then, yeah, the other big thing is that you can now view your theme JSON file, so the currently active themes JSON file. Again, we&#8217;ve got a view to enable editing of this as well in the editor. Again, just saving you jumping in between code editor and on WordPress. That&#8217;s another exciting one. Hopefully, saves people time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That was actually the biggest, whoa. When I demoed that, I added a few custom colors and showed them in the editor and then saved them. The only barrier is you have to do two saves, you have to save it in the database or on the editor, and then you have to click on save and the Create Block plugin sidebar. Then I was able to show them, okay, and now let&#8217;s look at the theme JSON, and it shows the little custom colors palette there. It was really a big help to show the power of this Great Block Theme plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> It&#8217;s nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Do you want to go through some of the changes from the change log of the plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yes. Let&#8217;s see what we haven&#8217;t talked about. We&#8217;ve talked about the UI refactor. One of the recent big changes has been now Create Block Theme will process any background images on the Group Block, which it previously didn&#8217;t do. I know that, that&#8217;s probably a really popular theme option when people are adding background images to the Group Block. Now those will be exported with a Create Block Theme export as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s great. I know I saw an issue also already used for one of the features that comes in 18.1, is the background for the whole site that you can add. That&#8217;s on the roadmap for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, it is. Although, I think that we&#8217;re handling that in Gutenberg as well, I think, which is really interesting, so that&#8217;s probably another. I think we&#8217;re making it relative to the theme or there&#8217;s some exploration there, anyway. We need to look into that in more detail on how we can use Create Block Theme alongside that because that&#8217;s really interesting. The other thing I wanted to mention, is another recent update is you can now persist the safe changes options. The ones I run through before, there&#8217;s quite a lot and they&#8217;re basically surfaced as check boxes. If you&#8217;re a theme builder or if you&#8217;ve build in a lot of themes, you&#8217;re probably going to use the same options every time. There&#8217;s a new option now that will remember the check-boxes that you use basically, so you don&#8217;t have to keep unchecking or checking boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Very helpful. Yes, thank you. Awesome. This is your little knowledge bit on the Create Block Theme. I really love that plugin and it had changed. From what I hear in the Outreach Channel and also with the people that I talk to, is that it changed the workflow on building block themes quite a bit and made it so much easier to just create themes. The only thing that it doesn&#8217;t do yet, I&#8217;m thinking, is to switch off some of the features of the Block Editor that are in the custom settings. If you want to switch off dimension controls or if you want to switch off custom color settings or something like that, you still have to do that or have the theme JSON, but I think that&#8217;s just one part that you still need to touch code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. We should introduce a new modal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think there were some great examples there in the early days of block themes, because many theme developers or agency developers actually have this that build bespoke themes for one project and never replicated for any other project. They have this need to introduce guardrails on colors and typography because it&#8217;s brand styling. If you give users too much freedom on that design, they come up with your own designs and sometimes that&#8217;s detrimental to the clean look and feel of a website, so they want to build some guardrails. Right now, that&#8217;s only possible through theme JSON or theme support in the functions PHP. I also can see that most of those developers are not using the Create Block Theme out of the box. They&#8217;re using some of their themes and then have those theme JSON settings already in there and then use the Create Block Theme to just make the additional changes on the templates and on the colors or something like that. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s big, but it could be something we could look into.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.5.3 RC1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there was already a release to the WordPress releases, we have WordPress 6.5.3 release candidate, was just released, and it&#8217;s now available for testing. The final release is scheduled for May 7th. That&#8217;s next week. Many of you are listening to this past ad, so go and update your WordPress instances on your websites. It contains about 18, not a bad day, it contains exactly 19 bug fixes discovered with WordPress 6.5 release that couldn&#8217;t wait until 6.6 and also wasn&#8217;t supposed to wait. They are out now. You can follow up on the full list via the announcement post that will be in the show notes. There weren&#8217;t any particular bug fixes that stand out where I said, all good that, that is fixed, but also didn&#8217;t work too much with 6.5. I&#8217;m glad contributors worked on that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, let&#8217;s get to the two last Gutenberg releases. The first tagline, Gutenberg 18.1, it was a fairly large release and, Release Lead Ramon Dodd, had the release post on what&#8217;s new in Gutenberg 18.1. That&#8217;s the release that answer has the background image for the Site Editor, but let&#8217;s take it from the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> The first one we were going to talk about is the zoom out, so this is invoking zoom out mode when opening the Patterns tab. It&#8217;s a great enhancement, because I think whenever you, or I guess most of the time when you insert a pattern, you&#8217;re going to want to see a bird&#8217;s eye view or well, literally, a zoomed-out view of your page because otherwise, you&#8217;re going to be zoomed into a smaller area of the page and it&#8217;s hard to see the new pattern or visualize where you want the pattern to go when you can only see a small section of the page. This invokes zoom out mode when you open the Patterns tab. I&#8217;d love to hear some feedback around if people are finding this useful as well. I think it feels very natural as well. It feels like a very nice animation that happens as well when you open the Patterns tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I like it too. Also, in the Site Editor, you can now rename pages through the actions three-dot menu. Pages are now in the Site Editor, you can view them through the data view, the whole DataViews&#8217; new components and tables and the different layout views. You can have the grid layout view of all the pages and on your site, and then you have three-dot menus on the bottom of each card that gives you immediate actions that you can take with a page. One of them is rename a page, give it a new title, even if it&#8217;s a no-title page kind of thing. It&#8217;s an easy way to fix headlines and all that. I really like it for the new admin sections there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris</em>: Another update to that page view that you&#8217;ve just been talking about is well, updating the index view. I think these changes are all related to the DataViews project. There&#8217;s some really good work going in here. It brings there the list of pages to the new DataViews section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>The List View, so you have on the left-hand side, you have the navigation that is in the dark background, and then the List View shows you each page with a thumbnail or something like that in the title. Then when you click on it, it opens up another panel where you can see the whole page. It&#8217;s also quite interesting for the workflow that was, you never were able to do that in WordPress before. It was always you had to click on it and then it opens it again. This is much smoother and you can browse all the pages quite easily and to see how they look. It seems to be magical that they actually display the front-end view of the page in the editor, so it&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Instead of having to click into a page, wait for a page reload and then click another one and wait for another reload. It&#8217;s now right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, right there. The same, we see that for the pattern pages, there&#8217;s now also a table layout where you can see the patterns and then it opens it up. Then the content schema for pattern editing view. I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what that was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> It&#8217;s when you can name blocks in a pattern, and then when you come out to the pattern view when you&#8217;re inserting a pattern, you&#8217;ll be able to see a content panel. Then those name blocks will show in that content panel. It&#8217;s probably good if you watch the video, the handy video that&#8217;s on the PR. It probably does a better explanation. It&#8217;s going to be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, that helps me quite a bit because sometimes you see paragraph heading, paragraph heading, heading, heading, image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You don&#8217;t know exactly where you&#8217;re on the page, but if things have a name you know, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m in the right section where I want to change things in the List View. The List View is, I&#8217;m obviously not creating too much content because the List View is not part of my muscle memory. When I was demoing things from the theme and how things are changed, I never opened up the List View and people asked me behind that. The List View is always open, how to navigate the whole pages and all that. It&#8217;s definitely a change in muscle memory to open that up because the List View wasn&#8217;t really helpful in the first few years of the Block Editor, so I didn&#8217;t develop that. Okay, next. Next is a background UI controls that are now really extensive. You can have, what was it? The focus on the image. You can have a tiled background image on things and you can have a section, but this is set for the top level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yes, I think so. Well, so I think it&#8217;s related to the top level, the new top-level background image setting. As we tend to do in Gutenberg, we&#8217;ll add the setting, the new style setting to theme JSON. Then this PR I think that we&#8217;re looking at is adding the UI controls. This surfaces it in the editor. This is, again, it&#8217;s very close to theming. It really elevates what you can do for themes. Again, this would&#8217;ve just been, you would&#8217;ve had to do it with code and probably custom CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Now you can, through the editor, you can change the background position, you can change the repeat, yes or no, or the background size of it, does it cover the whole thing, or there&#8217;s another one restrained. You can just upload the image there. I like background images, it gives so much more dimensions and layers to the Block Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, it does. I really love web designs that use a big full-size background image. That&#8217;s the kind of design I like. I&#8217;m really pleased to see this come to the editor. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> There&#8217;s something that the DataViews, and I know it was there before that you can clear out customizations to templates, but now you also get a confirmation modal. I have learned that when you want to do, so some people wanted to switch out the theme, no, the updates of the theme doesn&#8217;t update templates at all when they were previously changed because the user changes trump the theme changes. When you update a theme on your site and you want the new changes coming in on templates for themes, you need to clear out the customizations beforehand. It&#8217;s a little bit of a quirk right now, and I don&#8217;t know how to solve this because of the hierarchy of changes, but maybe the Create Block theme. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a scope for that as well, but it&#8217;s something users and theme developers need to get their head around that, that&#8217;s actually what&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, exactly. Maybe a good solution here for the first case, it&#8217;d just be to surface what&#8217;s going on and try and explain to people just different levels of saving and this is how it works, like the template hierarchy, you just have to get used to that. Maybe there&#8217;s a first step of just telling people where things are being saved. I think this change helps you be less unintentionally destructive as well, because resetting things, it&#8217;s just, &#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t realize I was going to clear everything.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you&#8217;re so right. Well, there are people who don&#8217;t press a button because they fear that they set up a nuclear bomb, but some people are just clicking around and saying, &#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; but it all made it disappear. For them, it&#8217;s the next step as kind of have a confirmation modal, so you can think twice about what you&#8217;re doing there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> The next one we&#8217;ve got is related to the List View you just mentioned. I think this makes it much easier to navigate. It&#8217;s adding keyboard shortcut to collapse List View items, but excluding the focused items. You&#8217;ve got the List View on the left-hand side and say you do have a lot of content, unlike Birgit, depending on the length, I think it can be challenging to navigate just because it&#8217;s another scrollable section. Adding this keyboard shortcut makes it much easier to collapse nested groups, basically. Yeah, it&#8217;s a good addition. Again, it&#8217;s probably good to watch the video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s definitely also a good quality of life kind of thing. I think that was for the enhancement of 18.1, Gutenberg plugin updates, 18.1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one thing that is available was an accessibility change for the DataViews that you can update. It has updated keyboard navigation in the list layout, so you can navigate through that through your keyboard, which is very important, so you don&#8217;t have to wait for the screen reader to announce everything. Then how do you get there? By keyboard. That&#8217;s a good thing. I think that was it for 18.1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can now immediately go into the change law of 18.2, and that was a mammoth release with 234 individual PRs by 56 contributors. Four of them completely new, but it also was that large because there were two more days on the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It wasn&#8217;t released on a Wednesday, it was released on a Friday of last week. Let&#8217;s head into it. </strong>Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First things, all kind of animation changes that I clustered together. It makes it a little bit easier that, that&#8217;s animation, it&#8217;s not very distracting animation. It&#8217;s more like a feedback animation. It adjusts the frame, it animates the radios on the frame, it improves the header animation. The animation for opening and closing the editor right-side bar, the insert and List View panels. This is more like when you move through the editor, you get feedback on where you are and where you go. I think those are really good features. They&#8217;re mostly invisible, but you&#8217;re just going to feel them, that it&#8217;s nice out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> They&#8217;re small, tiny changes that make a big difference when they&#8217;re all grouped together, especially, just makes everything feel a little bit nicer to use. Next up, we&#8217;ve got using the grid layout by default on the templates in template parts view. Again, this is related to the DataViews work, I think. The grid makes more sense because they&#8217;re more visual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Template parts and templates are so visual. In their nature though, it&#8217;s good to see them, even if it&#8217;s only a tiny grid layout card, but it helps you navigate them without. You see them all in one scroll and then you can navigate to the one that you wanted to go to. Template parts are now patterns, so if you&#8217;re looking for your template parts, look on the patterns because there&#8217;s a big similarity between what patterns are sync patterns and template parts. They&#8217;re mostly all reusable things that can be, and so they&#8217;re clustered under the Patterns section. There is a simplified template reset language that kind of goes with 18.1 modal probably on resetting template changes customizations. What else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> There&#8217;s also related to what you were just saying about template parts I think in the Patterns, we now have an author field in that view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You can filter by, is it a template part or is it coming from the theme, or is it coming from the user and which user? It&#8217;s definitely helpful to navigate the whole thing and filter it when you have many, many template parts on the page. Yeah, so good, thank you. Then the editor, also in those layouts, you see in the editor now the word count and reading time in the post card, it&#8217;s not in the post, it&#8217;s more in the pages view, not in the post view, but you see them on the left-hand side in your screen. In the single Meta page screen. We need to get them all those names in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> I think it&#8217;s related to, because we have that information is surfaced within the editor when you&#8217;re browsing templates, and so I think we&#8217;re trying to align the data that surfaced in both areas so it&#8217;s more familiar and not confusing. There&#8217;s some data that appears here and different data that appears when you are editing the post. We&#8217;re trying to align them to reduce confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s good to have that information right there with a page metadata here, a template. Then the next feature is that the template preview is now available in the post editor for non-administrators, because non-administrators also can change the templates, so now they can see the preview. I think that&#8217;s in the sidebar. When you&#8217;re editing a post or a page, in the sidebar, you can switch out the template. To know which template you use, you need to see what it is, so you get a preview of the templates that you can search for or look at before you switch them out. That&#8217;s definitely a good way to help content creators to do the right thing there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> The publish flow has also been updated, so this is related to published status label.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, it makes it clearer what the state of a post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> This is on the post summary panel. It shows you, you might have noticed that when you use the Gutenberg plugin, that the featured image in some of the other data is now in a so-called summary panel on the post were the former called document settings. There, you can also see what nature it is. Is it a draft, is it a published one or not? Then you see the featured image and also the template and the URL and when it&#8217;s published and all that. That is now much clearer what status your post is about. Well, the page,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The next thing is the Patterns page has now edit and view revision actions to the parts. Template parts now also surface the revisions in the editor, so you can see what&#8217;s changed here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> In the three-dots menu, I think we mentioned that similar to the title change that&#8217;s been surfaced, so these are new options in that three-dot menu for editing and viewing the revisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The resetting, you can also reset it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Reset, yeah, and delete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Then the Site Editor now also supports startup patterns. It did for the page view, when you go through the WP Admin and to create a new page, it showed you already startup patterns when they came in with a theme, but the Site Editor page management system didn&#8217;t have that yet. This is just creating feature parity between the two views, the startup patterns, so you can select different page layouts, and you don&#8217;t have to start from a blank page which a lot of people have anxiety about. You can start about, so you see, okay, this is my header section, my middle section, and my additional service section or whatever is in the startup pattern. Full-page layouts can be done, can be surfaced through the theme, and now you have them inside editor as well. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> The next one we&#8217;ve got is we&#8217;ve improved the override indication for editable blocks in synced patterns. This is if you&#8217;ve inserted a synced pattern somewhere. Then when you&#8217;re looking around to edit things, things will be generally highlighted. There&#8217;ll be an outline around the block that can be edited. This update removes the outline that highlights things that can be edited. It removes it from things that can&#8217;t be edited in a synced pattern. Again, it&#8217;s kind just like a quality of life or UX improvement that feels, or maybe looks small, it makes everything feel a lot more easy to understand immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It takes the mystery out of it. You don&#8217;t have to click around and say, can I? Can I do? The next thing is in the zoom out mode, there&#8217;s an introduction of section containers where you can assemble patterns into sections and then zoom out or see them in the zoom out mode. There&#8217;s much work being done in creating sections that can be styled and all that. Well, that was a PR that went through multiple changes. Well, it started in February and has just been merged, and it&#8217;s April, so it took about two months to get through this. You were saying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Sorry. I was going to say, I think it&#8217;s related to some of the 6.6 changes, especially some of the things that we talked about in the recent Hallway Hangout. I think this is like some groundwork for section styling and being able to style parts of either patterns pages or entire themes, rather than thinking you might have to apply something to everything. You can now break it down into sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Cool. We will have a link to the Hallway Hangout that you just mentioned. That was what&#8217;s coming to 6.6, but we&#8217;re going to briefly talk about it as well and have the show notes, of course, have a link to it. The next two are DataViews changes. Again, there&#8217;s a lot of work being done, so it&#8217;s really hard to keep up, but every time you open up the Gutenberg Site Editor in the Gutenberg plugin, it has little changes in there. One is that you can now display fields as a batch in the grid layout. Then you can make checks, boxes and actions visible on touch devices, which actually is really helpful when you&#8217;re on a tablet or on mobile. There is also an experiment out of custom views. I&#8217;m not quite sure what that entails, but I&#8217;m going to look at it real quick. Do you have anything to add to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> I think when I was reading this before, I think this is because the DataViews work is now not experimental, it&#8217;s moving the custom DataViews into an experiment. Rather than all the DataViews being an experiment, it&#8217;s just moving this single part of it, the custom DataViews as being experimental. You have to enable it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Is that the beginning of making DataViews a little bit extensible and you can create custom views or is that not that part?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> I think it is. It&#8217;s like when you create your own reports in data reporting tools and stuff like that, you can create your own view for, well, I&#8217;ve seen the demo for creating your own view for pages, but I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have many others. Again, it just gives users a little bit more control. It makes things feel more professional as well, because you can give it specific names rather than it all sounding very specific WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, the same, basically from the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think it comes with a work for custom post types as well. If you need custom post types, custom fields, that&#8217;s all that whole soup of complexity and extensibility that comes with it. This is good that there&#8217;s already some work being done on that part. Because we already get some questions about extensibility of the DataViews use, and people who have done this with WP Admin are keen to see how they can work with the new components in the DataViews. This is definitely a good thing to start out with that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there were some changes for the layout pieces of the Site Editor. It added the row control for grid layouts in manual mode, which is good. It needs some testing and some feedback. You can also now, and this is what a lot of people are waiting for, is applying negative margins. We talked about it before, I think here on the podcast, but applying negative margin was something that a lot of people were waiting for, doing it in UI. It was always possible through theme JSON, but now there&#8217;s some UI or some settings that you can do in the sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, and we&#8217;ve also reduced the specificity of the layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s why I leave it to you. I can&#8217;t pronounce that word. Specificity, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Again, it makes it hopefully easier for themers or anyone interacting with CSS. It makes it much easier rather than unexpectedly being overridden by CSS from Gutenberg. This change will hopefully make that a lot easier. There&#8217;s some changes like we&#8217;ve wrapped existing styles in a ware block, so which makes them less specific. I believe the semantic class names have been improved as well, but I think I might be jumping into a different PR there, but hopefully, it all collectively makes styling things much easier for Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think the semantic thing with just an 18.3. Yeah, it&#8217;s coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, we talked about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No problem to mention it here, it&#8217;s coming. To say it&#8217;s not the last that we work on it. Then for the Global Styles, we talked about the background image or mentioned it, now you can have a display of default background for the size value in the Global Styles. We have the background UI control labels that are changed and then you use text and button background color for color indicators. There&#8217;s a lot of things that improve handling background images in the Global Styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Then this other one we&#8217;ve got for Global Styles is the color indicators now use the text and button background colors. I think this helps make the color palette selection clearer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> It&#8217;s when you start variations, I think it helps. Again, it probably helps to see this visually in the PR. When you view browse styles in Global Styles panel, if a theme has multiple style variations, you&#8217;ll see a little, like a preview box that previews the typography, the background image, and then two other theme images, theme colors, sorry, from the color palette. This changes those two colors to use the text and button background colors. I think it just generally gives you a better idea of the variation color palette compared to previously. Another good improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">APIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Especially, yeah. There are new APIs in 18.2, and they definitely need some testing because there&#8217;s now additional support for the plugin post status info in the slot for the Site Editor. Most of the changes are actually to give the plugin a more menu item for the API. Then what&#8217;s the other one? Plugin site, more menu item, that&#8217;s one. Then the other one is unify the plugin sidebar slot between the post and Site Editor. Because most of the time, you need the feature from a plugin in, in both. Because if it&#8217;s a plugin with blocks, blocks can be used in the Site Editor as well as in the post editor. It&#8217;s really beneficial to have those slots there. You could add as a plugin developer something into the post status info and you can create, so unify plugin, more menu item, you can create more menu items. I think some of the UIs, I feel that the Create Block Theme is actually using some of those new APIs already because it feels a little bit differently than before where you can open a menu and then have another slot and all that. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, exactly. I think these are the API changes of bringing more parity to the, like you said, between the post and Site Editor. I think most of these changes are moving these APIs into the editor package. Instead of them being separated, they&#8217;re only included in one package, and then that makes it much easier for plugins to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Then they don&#8217;t have to include too many packages to use those. I think going through the create plugin GitHub repo might help quite a few plugin developers to find some solutions for their move away from the Meta boxes or the WP Admin setting pages into the editor. That&#8217;s a new avenue there. Maybe we need to do a Developer Hour on how did you do this? All right. I really like that, how this all comes together. You&#8217;re right, if you scroll further on the changelog, you get to the ad semantic classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> I knew I&#8217;d seen it somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Then there were some changes on the interactivity API. You can now have multiple event handles for the data WP on directive. That is really helpful because you can have for different actions on a button, you can have different event handlers. That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, it is. The other one we&#8217;ve got is updating the query block to allow, oh, non-interactive blocks. Sorry, non-core. I&#8217;m missing a vital word. Non-core interactive block, so you can include any block. Any block that enables the interactivity. API can now be included in the query block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s really helpful when you have custom post types with some interactions there. We love it. Cool. The interactivity API is another powerful feature that only in the next few months we&#8217;ll see really the extent of how powerful it actually is and what other people do with it. There have been quite a few Developer Hours with it. Some examples, there was a developer blog post about the introduction of the interactivity API. Earlier, or last month, there was a Developer Hours with creating blocks with the interactivity API with another real-world example. I know that Ryan Welcher is now working on his Twitch stream on doing a to-do app with the interactivity API, and this shaped up quite nicely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part two, I think, happened this week. I will put all these interactivity API mentions into the show notes so you can look up about them, what happened in last month about that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed &#8211; WordPress 6.6 Hallway Hangout</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This concludes our what&#8217;s released sections and we are really way into the hour, but I wanted to still talk with you, Sarah, about the Hallway Hangout on what&#8217;s next in Gutenberg. There was a demo time, I think it was an hour and a half, where product managers and designers came together and demoed how certain things are going to work and what they&#8217;re preparing for the 6.6 version that&#8217;s coming out. Beta will be June 4th and it will come out on July 8th. I think that&#8217;s the schedule. Of course, so then the last version of Gutenberg coming in, I think it&#8217;s 18.5. We are now 18.3 release candidate is out, so we are about three releases away from beta. Isn&#8217;t that scary?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> It&#8217;s terrifying, and everything moves so fast. You think you&#8217;ve got a break, and you haven&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> What was the topic about, or what did we cover? What was covered in the Hallway Hangout? It was the data view efforts in the relationship with the admin redesign. I think that was a part of the extensibility there. I think the biggest piece is the overrides and sync pattern because that changed. It was slated for WordPress 6.5, but then got pulled after beta one when the flow was not as intuitive as one would&#8217;ve wanted. It&#8217;s a similar setup, so when you have a pattern that is synced, you can enable overwrites. What you also have to do is to give the overrides a name for each single override so people that use the pattern can see in the sidebar which are the things that you can override and can click on it. I think that is a very good demo to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll share the summary of posts on make core in the show notes, and there were quite few smaller videos in there that show off some of the new features that are coming. You and I, we just talked about the zoomed-out view. There is some advanced content only editing in how that is handled. Then of course, another big feature is a grid layout support that&#8217;s coming and the pattern styles, which means that you have a section in a website that you can attach a style universally without having to style each additional block that&#8217;s in that section. Is that what I&#8217;m hearing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yes. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s right. Similar to how we can currently apply different style variations to an entire theme. This would allow you to apply style variations or any other kind of variation of global styles, I guess. I&#8217;m trying not to say style variations again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Lots of expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, that&#8217;s right. It makes it much easier to get some more variety of styling, and means you don&#8217;t have to switch themes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think that what I find how things are changed in the Global styles and if you needed it to be overall change for the whole site or do you want to just for this post and where those change is happening. There are attempts to find a way to clarify where things have been changed or where they&#8217;re styled, and so you can actually reverse some of the things. Revisions probably helped, certainly. The Hallway Hangout was quite interesting to see. Was there anything that stood out for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> It&#8217;s hard to pick, actually. I think the DataViews work is really, really cool and really sets us up for the admin redesign work. It&#8217;s just really nice to see these fresh designs go into WordPress. I also really like anything to do with Patterns because I work with themes a lot, so all of that is super interesting and it&#8217;s giving users a lot more control and allowing different areas to be edited. Then some areas are locked down, just a lot more control is really, really good. Also, on the zoomed-out view, that content only editing view is very interesting too because I think it&#8217;s all in the name. It only allows you to edit the content rather than being distracted by editing all the other blocks that are surrounding the content. Again, really interesting stuff going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It also helps the developers that do bespoke site to kind of put up some the guardrails more intuitively for the content creators and not just make it easy for them to create those. Yes, so definitely, dear listeners, if you only get one thing out of this hour of Gutenberg Changelog, follow up on the show notes and look at the summary of the Hallway Hangouts for what&#8217;s next in Gutenberg. Because it gives you a pretty good preview way ahead of time of what will come into WordPress 6.6, and there&#8217;s quite a lot that&#8217;s coming as you can hear. We are at the end of the show. Is there anything else you wanted to highlight before we close out that you didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk about it? Because it will be chopped up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> No, I think we talked about everything. Well, there&#8217;s always too much as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We shouldn&#8217;t wait a month to catch up everybody up on the Gutenberg happenings. Before I end on the show, I wanted to remind everyone on the Developer Hours on alternatives from Meta boxes, May 14th. If you listen to this after May 14th, go to one of the last weekend editions on the Gutenberg Times and you&#8217;ll find the recording of that hour so you can follow up after the fact. I think it&#8217;s definitely also a video to watch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, as always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com for the podcast. This is episode 99. If you have questions and suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are still listening and haven&#8217;t switched off, we have episode 100 coming up, and it will be a special edition of the Gutenberg Times. I will talk with the agency that did the redesign of the NASA website, and we will talk about WordPress scales as well as implementation challenges and pathways to migrate content, decisions about how to decide on core blocks or custom blocks, and have a good time with the agency, the content creator, team members and developers on how they actually accomplish that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks, everybody, for listening, and I wish you a wonderful weekend, week, say goodbye, and yeah, till the next time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 04 May 2024 11:13:50

And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Nahuai Badiola Nahuai is a freelance WordPress developer, theme and plugin creator. He also writes WordPress code tutorials, and enjoys sharing everything he learns about web sustainability in his blog, podcast, and at WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahuai&#8217;s life took an unexpected turn one day when he attended a 10 minute lightning talk at a WordCamp. The content of that talk was web sustainability, and it profoundly changed his perspective on how we should view our use of the internet. Nahuai has since been a vocal advocate for sustainability within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahuai extensively researched website sustainability, and came across The Green Web Foundation, exploring the broader dimensions of sustainability beyond just environmental impacts. This passion not only led to the creation of the podcast series, SustainWP, which aims to elevate the discourse on digital sustainability, but also to exploring practical ways WordPress can contribute positively to our planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Nahuai and I discuss the nuances of the environmental impact of web development with a particular focus on WordPress. We discuss ideas like reducing code in plugins, and highlight the performance team&#8217;s effort to make WordPress more green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The broader scope of sustainability, including economic and social pillars, is also on our agenda, underlining initiatives like sustainable contributor channels, and the intriguing potential of a plugin that helps reveal the environmental footprint of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about sustainability within WordPress web development, and the community more broadly, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Nahuai Badiola.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast By Nahuai Badiola.

Thanks for inviting me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re very, very welcome. I&#8217;m really happy to have you on today. We&#8217;re going to be talking a little bit about sustainability. I will let Nahuai explain what all of that means, in terms of your digital footprint, especially for your websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we do that Nahuai, would you just spend a few moments telling us your biography, maybe your WordPress origin story, something along those lines, just so that we know a little bit about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:51] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Good. Good. Yeah, I will do my best to, summarize it. So I will go to 2014. Okay, that was the first time I was starting building websites with WordPress. And back then I was still a neuroscientist, so I was following the researcher path. So I was doing my third postdoc in Italy, and I really enjoyed the research part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still do, I love researching things, but the researcher lifestyle, not that much. So at the end it&#8217;s a lot of time going to a workplace, and when you are a boss, or you are a researcher, you do a lot of paperwork, but a lot. And it was like, it doesn&#8217;t sound like the plan I want to do when I&#8217;m 40 or whatever when I arrive to that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started looking for options, as you can guess, after 15 years of, let&#8217;s say a specialization on neuroscience, it was like, what can I do? I always be very inclined to technology and the online stuff, so I always enjoyed that part, and I was lucky enough to find WordPress pretty early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say when I was saying, okay, maybe, I want to do something online. Maybe I want to become a freelance to have more freedom. You can laugh here if you want to because we know it&#8217;s not that easy. But I can say that I live much better right now than when I was a researcher, so it didn&#8217;t went that bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in that moment, I started using it as a user, just building websites for me. The typical travel blog for my wife and these kind of things. I was enjoying this, that part. I was also enjoying tinkering with code. So I was enjoying modifying themes or creating small snippets, these kind of things. And the really nice thing about WordPress is that you have a ton of content online. So that&#8217;s really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So another good thing is that there are cool podcasts about WordPress like this one. So I started to listen to them in English, but also in Spanish. And when I went back to Spain, where I&#8217;m from, if you didn&#8217;t notice my accent by now. I started going to meetups because I already heard about the community, Spanish community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s a quite active, and vibrant community. So I start going. Then I start giving some talks and then going to WordCamps, some talks in WordCamps. And then I was already falling in love with WordPress community, so I also started organizing the meetup in my hometown, not hometown, but where I live now, Terrassa, near to Barcelona.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was really into the community. I was really enjoying. I was pretty much going well business wise, let&#8217;s say. And there was a moment in, this is already 2019, so we move forward five years, I went to WordCamp Pontevedra, and there was a lightning talk, talking about the impact of internet in CO2 emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was like, wait, what? And the idea is pretty straightforward. So we know that the internet is this cloud, this thing that we think is ethereal, and it&#8217;s run by rainbows and cats and, but it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s really run by coal mainly. So the idea is, internet are servers. Those servers need energy. And that energy is mainly still coming from fossil fuels. So that&#8217;s that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everything you can do to reduce that footprint, it&#8217;s more than welcome. And in that moment, it was like, this was a quite obvious thing to think, but I didn&#8217;t think about it until I went to this talk. So that&#8217;s one of the realizations of the importance of going to this kind of events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes you just stumble upon a talk that you say, okay. Indeed, since then I&#8217;ve been researching digital sustainability. I&#8217;ve been also talking about it, and for not making this journey too long, I will just move to the part when I met Hannah Smith, probably in another WordCamp, WordCamp Europe, Berlin, also the same year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that I knew that she was already doing some research in digital sustainability. She was one of the, I don&#8217;t want to call it leader, but people that is sharing about it, and is good doing it. So I start talking with her. I just approach her and say, do you feel it&#8217;s okay if we talk online, of course, every month or every two weeks? And she was, let&#8217;s do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in that moment, that relationship went on. We talk mainly about digital sustainability. We really feel really close to our heart, that part. And thanks to that probably, I learn about the Green Web Foundation. This is a nonprofit, that is, they do a really cool things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably, if you heard it, you probably heard it because they have a directory of green hosting. So hostings that are using clean energy, let&#8217;s say. But they do much more things. One of the things they do is they have a fellowship. And that was when Hannah was part of the first cohort of the fellowship, and she did a really cool workshop. It&#8217;s called Doing the Donut. I will leave you the link so you can share it, but I don&#8217;t want to spend too much time here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to say it was a brilliant workshop, interactive workshop I attended as a attendant. And the idea was to put into perspective the impact of digital. Things we do as business, as consumers, in the environmental, and the sociological, and the economic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was one of the first approach of, okay, sustainability is maybe not only the environmental part, but there is also a social and economic part. So that was another aha moment, let&#8217;s say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think getting into the social and the economic part would interesting in a moment. But just for now, so 2014, the beginnings of this, but really the whole of your future really pivoted around a 10 minute lightning talk. You can imagine a scenario in which you just decided, I won&#8217;t go that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:26] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Skip it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, somebody said, let&#8217;s go get a coffee, and your life would be profoundly different. I often have conversations with people who turn up to a WordPress event, and they&#8217;re not really sure what it is that&#8217;s going to catch their attention. But there&#8217;s always something, whether it&#8217;s volunteering or the code or whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But fascinating, just really interesting that 10 minute lightning talk led to such a profound change in your life. And the Green Web Foundation, and the fellowships, and all of that bound into it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, okay, for those people who are listening, it may be that you have never connected the word sustainable, or sustainability, with the environment. So that&#8217;s I think one of the things that we want to drive home. Every time you hear that word in the WordPress landscape from now on, you are thinking about the environmental impact. But more broadly as well as we&#8217;ll get onto the social, and the economic impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you&#8217;ve taken this to a really interesting new level as well because you like recording the audio and putting a podcast out. So I want to draw attention to everybody. Maybe if you are anywhere near a computer, just hit pause and go and search for SustainWP. It&#8217;s a podcast series, and I&#8217;m really, I&#8217;m just going to hand it over to you. What was the point of that podcast series?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:42] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> So linking to what I was saying about Hannah&#8217;s workshop. It was a brilliant way of putting together things that I didn&#8217;t thought about it before. So I really liked the philosophy of trying to be more aware in our space. So I say, okay, this is frame in detail, digital sustainability as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to move it to WordPress. Let&#8217;s say we do a workshop about it. The workshop thing didn&#8217;t went far, so I moved to the podcast format, and the idea was indeed the sustainability piece, a limited podcast series. So it&#8217;s nine episodes, and the idea is to see the different parts in monographic episodes, let&#8217;s say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one is like an introduction of what are you going to find there. But then I move forward and explain what are the three pillars of sustainability, as you say, the environmental, the economical, and the social. But I don&#8217;t do it alone, because that would be not that much interesting. But I invited too, 13 guests. Brilliant people from WordPress community, and also from the digital sustainability, let&#8217;s call them again, leaders or thought leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at the end, you can hear pretty much the ideas of every one of them in the different topics. So you are not going to listen to a whole interview, but I will extract snippets of audio, give it context, and put it and wrap it in every episode. That&#8217;s a lot of work, by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thanks again to the Green Web Foundation, because I was able to do it thanks to the Green Web Foundation Fellowship that I was awarded in the second cohort. So that&#8217;s why I could do this more refined format, let&#8217;s say. Just to explain that is a different format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just to interrupt there, I think podcasting, it really hadn&#8217;t occurred to me that podcasting as a distribution medium is actually fairly sustainable. Video, it consumes a lot of resources. If you begin playing that then there&#8217;s megabytes and megabytes of data flowing around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:46] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah, the website is quite low carbon. Also, another cool thing about podcasting, feed, it&#8217;s a feed. That&#8217;s a really nice thing in sustainability. The social part is also like, it&#8217;s accessible to everyone. You have to be married to any platform. You can listen in the web, in your podcatcher. That&#8217;s another really cool thing about podcasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end is, we talk about the three pillars in sustainability and how they understand them. So I think that it was really interesting for me. I hope more people find it interesting. And then we took these three lenses and talk about how we can improve WordPress, in an events level, because we meet quite a lot, and we like to meet. It&#8217;s brilliant we meet. I already explained that I have a lot of good things from those meetings. But maybe we can meet in a more sustainable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other part is about the CMS, how we can do the CMS, let&#8217;s say more sustainable. This part is, the environmental part is very important because WordPress is installed in millions of installations. So everything that we can improve performance wise. And here, I want to give a great kudos to the Performance Team, because they are doing brilliant work here. A lot of cool improvements are coming to WordPress. Lazy load, all the assets that are loaded, only if the block is there. Brilliant stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the formats, also the WebP. Brilliant stuff. But also we have, since it&#8217;s an open source project, we also have the longevity part there. Because, this is run by people that is put in there voluntarily, or maybe sponsored by some companies. But that part is also really important. How we can keep this project ongoing for a lot of years, because I think that it can. So, we also tackle those topics, and that&#8217;s the part that is more socioeconomic. We talk about Five for the Future project and other stuff. And I think there were a lot of interesting ideas and discussions about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just ask a quick question? Well, one question and then one observation. The first one is, you mentioned a few times the three pillars. Just to cement into everybody&#8217;s heads, would I be right in saying that&#8217;s environment, social, and economic? Are they the pillars? Okay. So just wanted spell that one out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing, which is an observation, is, yeah, it really hadn&#8217;t occurred to me quite so profoundly until you just said it, that if you can modify the CMS, which powers 43% of the web, in one stroke, you are doing so much good. If you can cut out, I don&#8217;t know, 10 kilobytes, or a hundred kilobytes, or a megabyte from every single WordPress website, millions and millions of times over, you&#8217;re doing profoundly good work, by doing one thing. And that really hadn&#8217;t hit home for reasons I can&#8217;t explain, but okay, that&#8217;s really amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:51] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> I want to mention one example. That one was eyeopening for me, let&#8217;s say. It was when Danny van Kooten share the impact it has to remove, I think it was 20 kilobytes of JavaScript from one of his plugins. I think it was MailChimp for WooCommerce. And since that plugin was I installed in, I think, 2 million WordPress or something like that, it was tons of CO2 he was reducing. Just because of those 20 kilobytes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So 20 kilobytes from his plugin, which by the sounds of it, has an enormous user base. 20 kilobytes spread across those 2 million websites, and I guess he&#8217;s doing some analysis of how many times his plugin is loaded and all of that, tons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:40] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah, tons. I don&#8217;t remember. And I think he also put it in car travel or something like that. It was like a lot of car travel, or a lot of kilometers done in car, and it was like, this is huge. So that was a popular plugin. Imagine what can be done in Core that can have potentially even more impact. And indeed, I think they are already doing it somehow in Performance Team. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting that the Performance Team, let me just rewind a bit. So the WordPress Performance Team has been going for, let&#8217;s go for about two years, something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:13] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Two or three, I think, yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nahuai&#8217;s holding up three fingers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:17] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah. because they started as part of Core, but now are established, so that&#8217;s why maybe we have two dates, but yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so three years and in that time, the messaging that seems to come out of that team, not from the team, but the interpretation I often have in my head is how much quicker it&#8217;s making WordPress. Because you always think of performance, oh, it&#8217;s going faster. And of course that&#8217;s true, and that&#8217;s great, but an intended consequence I guess, is this environmental, sustainable side of the performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, I hadn&#8217;t really joined the dots there. And if you are saying that 20 kilobytes, from a 2 million install plugin means tons of CO2. If we take megabytes out of the core of WordPress, that must be hundreds and hundreds of tons of CO2. I have no intuition as to what that number would be, but I&#8217;m guessing it would orders of magnitude more. Again, just another profound realization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:21] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> So, this team was already ongoing for let&#8217;s say two, three years, and they are doing brilliant stuff. Again, I can&#8217;t praise enough for their work. But, in parallel to this SustainWP project I was doing, and putting the dots together and seeing the sustainability not only as an environmental part, but also economic and social part. In parallel, we were creating a first sustainability initiative inside WordPress. And the last year in WordCamp Europe in Athens, we became an official team, after doing a lot of, all the steps that are needed to be a, an official team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to spend too much time on the process because I don&#8217;t want to take too much time. I want to tackle so many things. So I will encourage you if you&#8217;re interested on understanding better how the team was created. We have a dedicated episode in SustainWP, is the number seven. And there you can see how the evolution went.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m just to interrupt there and tell the listener the URL, because many people listening to this and won&#8217;t be desk or anything, so let&#8217;s put it in your head. It&#8217;s sustainwp.com. No hyphens or anything. Just sustainwp.com. And then if you go down to episode seven, it&#8217;s called WordPress Sustainability Team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can short circuit by listening to that episode. It seems to run to just under an hour. Sorry, carry on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:45] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> No, no, that was nice. Yeah, that&#8217;s, we have to remember this is audio and it&#8217;s always good to do this kind of stuff and say, hey, remember. So you will have it also in the show notes, but if you are interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at the end we&#8217;ve been doing, first in the initiative and now as an official team. We&#8217;ve been meeting in Slack every week, and we&#8217;ve been talking about how we can do the project more sustainable in all the areas. And one of the two projects that we have right now ongoing, and I will mention briefly in case you want to join us, because we are open to always to have new contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of them is the handbook that is aiming to create a more sustainable events. So as I say, we meet a lot, in meetups, WordCamps, and especially in the flagship WordCamps. A lot of stuff is moving around. So the idea is since the organizers we have to remember are volunteers, so they are not professional people that are usually creating these kind of events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They do what they can with the time they have. So the main idea is to put together a lot of ideas that could improve the sustainability of the event in a list. So they can go there and say, okay, I would like to do a bit more sustainable event. What can I do? Can I reduce the swag? That could be an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving the option to the user in the registration if they want to have a T-shirt, if they want to have a lanyard even, because I have already enough lanyards. So this kind of small things that maybe if we start to standardize it. Maybe we don&#8217;t need to create so much swag for the welcome pack, let&#8217;s say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we also have some ideas from sponsors. Indeed, some of the sponsors came to WordCamp Europe contributor day and they were willing to understand how they can do a bit better in that way. So some of them are already trying to do better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big part could be promoting the traveling. So traveling by train when it&#8217;s possible. And indeed in this years WordCamp Europe, in Torino, there is a dedicated page where there is information about the trains you can take if you are in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just putting easier to organizers to serve those resources. And then make it easier to the people that is attending to have maybe a more sustainable habits when they are going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess many of us have been to WordPress events, and obviously a lot of people have spent time organizing it. But like you say, it&#8217;s run by volunteers and it may well be that you just don&#8217;t have the ideas that would be contained in the handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ll link to the handbook as well, so go through that list and maybe some of those, if you&#8217;re a Meetup organizer, or if you&#8217;re a Word camp organizer, some of those things you could tick off. That&#8217;s, yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:44] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> That&#8217;s still a draft, but yeah, we will like to have it in a more definitive format by the WordCamp Europe this year in Torino. So hopefully we have it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> One other quick thing, you mentioned contributor day. If you don&#8217;t know what that is, the contributor day is often attached to the beginning or the end of a WordPress event. And the idea is that you show up and you put yourself onto a table, and that table has a theme, and you work on that thing for the duration of that day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it may be photography, it may be core, it may be marketing. So is there a sustainable or a sustainability table? Is that often the case now? If you were to go to one of the WordCamps, maybe one of the larger ones, is that a part of the agenda to get a sustainability table?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:25] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah, indeed. Last year we had the first one in Europe, let&#8217;s say in the first one in a flagship WordCamp. Because we already did in Barcelona and Pontevedra. This year is going to be also a contributor day with sustainability table in Torino. The idea is to be one of the tables that is usually set up for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we need someone that is coming to the meeting somehow, and they know more or less what are we working on? But yeah, yeah. The idea is to spread and have it as one of the, since we are already an official team, if in a WordCamp there is someone that is working in something that we are doing in a sustainability team, they are welcome to host the sustainability table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So call to action, dear listener. If are heading to a WordCamp event, particularly Torina, in the year 2024, WordCamp Europe, and you&#8217;re not sure where to put yourself for the contributor day, now you&#8217;ve got an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:19] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ll, provide links in the show notes, but maybe we&#8217;ll get some contact details for Nahuai as well, anyway. Brilliant, carry on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:26] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah, so we can link it with this. If the event handbook doesn&#8217;t sound appealing enough to come to the contributor day, or to come to the Slack meeting, we are also doing, creating a plugin that aims to surface some information about the impact, environmental impact. Of the website, probably in the WP admin, or site health, or we have to think where to put it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the end, the idea would be, the initial idea was to use some of the APIs that are there to surface how much CO2 is emitting your website, okay. Giving you some context. You are in the 10% dirtiest websites. Or, you are in the 15% more cleaner. So something like that. And also some resources to understand better what that means, because maybe that&#8217;s a new information for you, like it was for me in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea is to raise awareness. So the people that are using WordPress, they see that and if they are intrigued and they want to know more about it, they can understand better. And the following idea would be they take actions to improve that, okay. But that would be the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the plugin not only will surface where you stand in the panoply of websites, you know you&#8217;re in the top 10% in terms of sustainability, or you&#8217;re in the bottom 10%. But also in the future you&#8217;ll be providing guidance, things that you can do to mitigate the things that we have flagged. Okay, that&#8217;s fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:58] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> That will probably be another plugin because, and I will explain why we want to keep really simple, the one that is surfacing information about the environmental impact. Indeed, we are now thinking that maybe using CO2, calculating the CO2, it requires to do calls to a third party API, that we don&#8217;t want to do it, or include the library. And we don&#8217;t want to do it because the aim is to build a feature plugin that can go inside core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it has to be really lean, and clean, and comply with everything that is needed to be in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Including this into core. Sorry, I&#8217;m interrupting alot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah. no, that&#8217;s so nice because you&#8217;re excited with it. So I think this would be huge if we manage to do it. And we are taking steps slowly because of this. Because the aim is to be in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we manage to put some context there, maybe, I don&#8217;t know if CO2, but maybe it&#8217;s performance metric, and creating some kind of rating that also you can understand. So from A to F or whatever we decide. So the user can see a red F or a green A, and they say what that&#8217;s mean. And probably we have to put some links to understand better the context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But having that in core, I think it&#8217;s a brilliant way of raising awareness about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. One of the things that&#8217;s coming into my mind is that, obviously if you&#8217;re a WordPress professional, if you&#8217;re a web developer, I imagine you&#8217;ve scratched the surface on this topic a little bit. You&#8217;ve probably had at least some thought that, boy, we produce a lot of carbon with this industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the people who are managing the websites, the people who are in effect, the clients who have had the website built for them, who don&#8217;t really have the technical expertise, maybe they are content creators, or writers, or journalists or whatever it may be. It&#8217;s an interesting thing to present them with as well to surface in their mind, boy, my website, yes, of course. It&#8217;s running on a computer and it&#8217;s producing carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s also quite interesting, because the audience for that is much bigger than the developer audience. And so reaching out to those people and just injecting that thought. Okay, your website has an impact. That&#8217;s really profound as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:18] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah. And as it was for me, the environmental part and the CO2 part, in SustainWP we talk about the carbon tunnel vision that we usually have in sustainability. That means that in a lot of places we equate CO2 to sustainability. And that&#8217;s just one part, but is one of the parts that is easier to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We play so much with it. And I usually refer it as a Trojan horse. So you start talking about CO2, and the impact in the environmental part, and you gather some interest, and maybe you are, if you are good enough, you can learn them to understand that sustainability is not only environmental, and there are more things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And talking about this, one of the things that the team would like to improve is what I was mentioning before about the longevity of the project. Right now there are a lot of contributors, some of them are sponsored, which is brilliant, but others are not. The ones that are not sponsored, sometimes it&#8217;s okay for them because they are putting, let&#8217;s say two hours a week, and they are fine because they have all their stuff. But there is people putting more time than that, and probably it&#8217;s not sustainable in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one of the aims, and one thing that was already talking in the Community Summit last summer, was to create what I call for a lack of a better term, like a portal where we can put the contributors that are doing active stuff on the project, and are not sponsored, of course. And companies that are open to sponsor people that are contributing to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are acting a bit like a go-between to connect people who perhaps don&#8217;t have the expertise to get involved with this, but they have the finance. They have the capacity to put somebody in that chair, and they can pay them for their time and make that worthwhile. Okay. That&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:22] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah, so here probably one of the things that as a first idea or product that can go there. It would not contain the financial part, because that&#8217;s really tricky. It would be maybe just a way to contact. It&#8217;s a portal where you can connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. You are making the introductions. Right, I get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:41] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> And then they go wherever they want. They need to go to do the financial part. Because the financial part is quite tricky. And indeed there is already something put in place that is called WordPress collective community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, the WPCC. Yeah, I&#8217;ll link to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:59] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Exactly. And that&#8217;s an initiative that it&#8217;s ongoing. I think at least they already managed to sponsor, I think a couple of people. Basically you can put some money there as individual, but also any company can put some money there to sponsor people that is contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in this portal idea thing would be to have like a, a directory of people that is doing active things. And for that, maybe it&#8217;s going to be helpful, the metric dashboard, project that is starting. Meaning that probably the companies that want to put some money in someone, they want to see a specifics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this person is doing, let&#8217;s say, five hours in community team, and is doing this specific task. So they know that they are putting the money there. Or let&#8217;s say in plugins, review or in theme review, or whatever, team it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think there is a lot of potential there. I think the people in Five for the Future, are willing to improve some of the system that is there. Because right now, Five for the Future is a brilliant project, but I have the feeling that it&#8217;s mainly big companies sponsoring full-time to contributors, which is brilliant. And that&#8217;s why the pace of WordPress evolution is that fast. Because Automattic and other big companies are putting a lot of people working on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is, from my point of view, a lack of freelance that are putting time to the project. And they are not able to gain any sponsor, because maybe it&#8217;s tricky. It&#8217;s more tricky to sponsor part-time, someone, instead of having an employee just donated to. So I think we can improve some things there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m just talking about the idea, because I know there is interest in a lot of sense, and we just need to find the way of moving it forward. But I think it would be really beneficial if we can close that gap between contributors that are already doing things, and companies that are, they are understand they have to do something, give something back, or they want to have some cool people related with their brands, let&#8217;s say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What&#8217;s fascinating here is, there&#8217;s obviously the code side of things. Reducing the impact of the footprint that WordPress creates. But it also appears from everything that you&#8217;ve just said, that if code is not your thing, the sustainability team, they need your help in all sorts of other ways. Like trying to figure out how to marry up sponsors with contributors, freelancers with sponsors, and so on and so forth, how to actually shape that team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s very meta that, isn&#8217;t it? You want people on the team to help you figure out what the team will be doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, that&#8217;s perfect. So my guess is that you are, you have your doors wide open. You are hoping that people will listen to this and will come knock on your door, find it wide open, step inside. So where do we go? Where&#8217;s the best place, best place or places to find out more about the sustainability initiatives in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:04] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah, I think probably it&#8217;s coming to the weekly meetings. Probably we are going to move it to every two weeks, so we can have time to do more stuff between the meetings. We will leave the link of the Slack channel. It&#8217;s easy, we are the sustainability channel. So I think you can come and you can join some of the ideas that are going. You can drop your idea if you are willing to move it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of the posts I wrote in the Green Web Foundation Fellowship, during the fellowship, it was sustainability as an umbrella term, because I really think, and during this journey, I saw it even more clear, that sustainability has a lot of things that are, they can be under it. So that&#8217;s one of the benefits of having this team, and we can collaborate with performance. Indeed for the plugin that we were talking before, probably it makes sense, a lot of sense to collaborate with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is also parts of inclusivity and making the events, not only more sustainable in a environmental way, but also inclusive. And that&#8217;s why we also want to have a close relationship with the DEIB working group. I think you already talk with Birgit, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are a lot of things that maybe we don&#8217;t have to do everything under our team, but I feel we really need to collaborate well, or have good relationship with other working groups or with other teams. And yeah, it&#8217;s a really cool place to come, and drop your idea or join forces with the things that we are already doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> As with every episode, everything that Nahuai has mentioned, I will try to track it down, or probably Nahuai&#8217;s going to drop the links into our shared show notes. But everything that we&#8217;ve mentioned, I will endeavor to get on the WP Tavern website. So if you go to wptavern.com/podcast, search for this episode, and you&#8217;ll be able to see the show notes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the topic of our time this, isn&#8217;t it really. There are a few things which matter, and then there are some things which matter a lot, and this really does feel like it goes into the, this matters a lot, category. If somebody wanted to reach out to you just to bat some ideas around with you personally, that might be a good way in. Where can we get in touch with you personally?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:27] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Yeah, probably all the workers related stuff, Slack is a good place. If you are not there, you will probably join earlier or later. But if you don&#8217;t want to start there, you can find me also in Mastodon. I&#8217;m on Twitter, not very active, but I still have the account. And my website, and my mail. My mail is where I manage everything, so you can also find it. Even if it&#8217;s, if the website is in Spanish, you can go to contact and just write me something and, no problem. And yeah, I think that&#8217;s pretty much it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like, as I say, sustainability is so many things and we had limited time. I think we are doing good job putting everything together. If you really want to hear really cool ideas and some debates about it, we already did the plaque of SustainWP, but I really think that they were brilliant, the, guests. And if you&#8217;re interested in the topic, I think you can enjoy that podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Perfect. There&#8217;s nine episodes over there. It just remains for me to say a great big thank you. It&#8217;s amazing to hear somebody that&#8217;s quite so passionate about this subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ll have driven some engagement in your direction. Nahuai thank you so much for chatting to me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:40] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Thank you Nathan, and let&#8217;s hope somebody is the tipping point where they discovered this link as that talk in Ponte Vedra was for me, and they just start being interested in the topic. Thanks a lot Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have my fingers and my toes all crossed. Thanks so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:56] <strong>Nahuai Badiola:</strong> Bye bye.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://nbadiola.com/\">Nahuai Badiola</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahuai is a freelance WordPress developer, theme, and plugin creator. He also writes WordPress code tutorials and enjoys sharing everything he learns about web sustainability in his blog, podcast, and at WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahuai’s life took an unexpected turn one day when he attended a 10-minute lightning talk at a WordCamp. The content of that talk was web sustainability and it profoundly changed his perspective on how we should view our use of the internet. Nahuai has since been a vocal advocate for sustainability within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahuai extensively researched website sustainability and came across the Green Web Foundation, exploring the broader dimensions of sustainability beyond just environmental impacts. This passion not only led to the creation of the podcast series SustainWP, which aims to elevate the discourse on digital sustainability, but also to exploring practical ways WordPress can contribute positively to our planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Nahuai and I discuss the nuances of the environmental impact of web development with a particular focus on WordPress. We discuss ideas like reducing code in plugins, and highlight the Performance Team&#8217;s efforts to make WordPress more green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The broader scope of sustainability, including economic and social pillars, is also on our agenda, underlining initiatives like sustainable contributor channels and the intriguing potential of a plugin that helps reveal the environmental footprint of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about sustainability within WordPress web development, and the community more broadly, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

meetup for Arabic speakers across the world.\" />\nHere is Nada reading her own story aloud\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#arabic\">هذا المقال متاح باللغة العربية</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an unexpected twist, my life has led me on a path where I ended up working with WordPress almost every single day of my life…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-beginning\">The Beginning…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My story begins in Istanbul in 2016, I haven’t heard of WordPress then except in one encounter with a friend who used to be a renowned journalist and quit his job, learnt how to use WordPress, and became a full-time freelancer building and maintaining WordPress sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I graduated from the Faculty of Economics and Political Science and has worked most of my career then in PR and digital marketing roles where I had no contact or knowledge of WordPress. When I moved to Istanbul I interviewed and got a job at an advertising agency and part of my job requirement was to create an editorial calendar, write and optimize blogs for GoDaddy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my first time to run an editorial calendar myself, I enjoy creative writing and had to write countless papers for university but haven’t done it professionally. I was very excited about the opportunity to learn something new. I remember very well watching hours and hours of search engine optimization videos and thinking to myself: This feels so hard, almost impossible, little did I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent about 3 years managing the blog as part of my work and using WordPress every day, I slowly learnt how to navigate the plugins, do SEO and even launched the Arabic blog in 2019.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I must say that I enjoyed it a lot and was especially happy when I got to see the results of the hard work that was put in to maintain the blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-middle\">The Middle…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later I moved to GoDaddy as a marketing manager and trained a team to be responsible of the blog and I moved to a different role with different responsibilities. A couple of years pass, and I move to a new team where I’m responsible for the growth of some products and WordPress was a part of it… we meet again!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time I was working with WordPress with a different angle and perspective, not only as a user but looking at the marketing and community side of it, and this is when I heard about meetups and WordCamps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My dear friend Maja Loncar was the first one to introduce me to meetups and WordCamps and explained how WordPress is more than a CMS, it’s a community. Early 2023, I was asked to be part of the GoDaddy team going to WordCamp Asia 2023, and I must admit I was anxious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had been to many events before that but nothing like this one, and I started prepping for my first ever contributor’s day and WordCamp in Thailand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember Adam Warner’s reassuring words to me before the event which has helped me feel confident and at ease. I must say I had a wonderful time in Thailand, the community was very welcoming, and I got to meet a lot of wonderful people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first contribution was to the training team, and at that time I realized that there is no training material in Arabic, which made me think about meetups and WordPress communities for Arabic speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in Dubai, I started looking up meetups in the Middle East, and started reaching out to the organizers in hopes to bring them back to life and help or co-organize if possible. I was met with disappointment at that time as most of these meetups weren’t active anymore (especially after COVID) and the organizers weren’t enthusiastic or were too busy. I remember speaking with Maja about this, and she said: what don’t you start one yourself? She explained to me the amount of effort that’ll need to be done and I thought about it. A few months later I started an online meetup for Arabic speakers across the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meetup has been running for around a year now, and it’s been through ups and downs – this was also the title to my first talk in WordCamp Asia 2024 in Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-story-doesn-t-end-here\">The story doesn’t end here…</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since my first WordCamp, I’ve been to 3 other WordCamps and attended several meetups and got to meet and have genuine friendships within the community and I was honored to be a speaker in WordCamp Asia 2024.

ووردبريس نلتقي مرة أخرى!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">هذه المرة كنت أعمل مع WordPress بزاوية ومنظور مختلفين، ليس فقط كمستخدم، ولكن بالنظر إلى الجانب التسويقي والمجتمعي منه، وهذا عندما سمعت عن اللقاءات وWordCamps.<br />كانت صديقتي العزيزة مايا لوكنار أول من عرّفني على اللقاءات وWordCamps وشرحت لي كيف أن WordPress أكثر من مجرد CMS، إنه مجتمع. في أوائل عام 2023، طُلب مني أن أكون جزءًا من فريق GoDaddy الذي يذهب إلى WordCamp Asia 2023، ويجب أن أعترف أنني كنت قلقة.<br />لقد زرت العديد من الأحداث قبل ذلك، ولكن لا شيء مثل هذا الحدث، وبدأت في الاستعداد ليوم المساهم الأول على الإطلاق والWordCamp&nbsp; في تايلاند.<br />أتذكر كلمات آدم وارنر المطمئنة لي قبل الحدث والتي ساعدتني على الشعور بالثقة والراحة. يجب أن أقول إنني قضيت وقتًا رائعًا في تايلاند، وكان المجتمع مرحبًا جدًا، وقابلت الكثير من الأشخاص الرائعين.<br />كانت مساهمتي الأولى لفريق التدريب، وفي ذلك الوقت أدركت أنه لا توجد مواد تدريبية باللغة العربية، مما جعلني أفكر في اللقاءات ومجتمعات WordPress للمتحدثين باللغة العربية.<br />عندما عدت إلى دبي، بدأت في البحث عن لقاءات في الشرق الأوسط، وبدأت في التواصل مع المنظمين على أمل إعادة المجتمعات إلى الحياة والمساعدة أو المشاركة في التنظيم إن أمكن. وقوبلت بخيبة أمل في ذلك الوقت لأن معظم هذه اللقاءات لم تعد نشطة (خاصة بعد COVID) ولم يكن المنظمون متحمسين أو كانوا مشغولين للغاية. أتذكر أنني تحدثت مع مايا حول هذا الموضوع، فقالت: لما لا تبدأي به بنفسك؟ شرحت لي مقدار الجهد الذي يجب القيام به وفكرت في ذلك. بعد بضعة أشهر بدأت لقاء عبر الإنترنت للمتحدثين باللغة العربية في جميع أنحاء العالم.<br />بدأ اللقاء منذ حوالي عام، وقد مر بتقلبات &#8211;

I am your guest host, Angela Jin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:30] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Angela:</strong> I am delighted to be guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing and to talk about the Contributor Mentorship Program, a community-driven initiative in the WordPress space that is proving to really support contributor journeys. And joining me today is special guest, Hari Shanker, Five for the Future Program Manager. Welcome, Hari!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:02] <strong>Hari:</strong> Thank you, Angela. Excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:04] <strong>Angela:</strong> Now, before we dive into the Contributor Mentorship Program, can you first tell me a bit about yourself? I&#8217;d love to know a bit more about your role as Five for the Future Program Manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:16] <strong>Hari:</strong> Sure. So, my name is Hari Shanker. I live in India in a city called Kochi. And I&#8217;d like to share some context to explain what I do. I am a sponsored contributor working full-time on WordPress, and I have been contributing primarily to the WordPress Community Team full-time since April 2020, where I am a Community Program Manager, formerly known as a Super Deputy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since September 2022, I have been working exclusively on projects that bolster the WordPress contributor experience. A key part of this work is my role as the Program Manager for the Five for the Future program, where my day-to-day work involves supporting and empowering companies and individuals that have pledged a part of their time to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:00] <strong>Hari:</strong> In parallel, I also lead the Contributor Working Group of the WordPress Community Team, which has the goal of making the contributor experience in WordPress the best it can be. Our recent focus has been on running an experimental contributor mentorship program as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Angela:</strong> Excellent. Thank you. So, I was recently at Open Source Summit, and figuring out funding and commitments to projects was a very hot topic. And people were really interested in Five for the Future. And so, Hari, would you mind giving us a quick overview of what Five for the Future is, and how it aims to support the WordPress open source project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:44] <strong>Hari:</strong> Absolutely. The Cofounder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg, launched Five for the Future in 2014 as a call to action for organizations and individuals who have benefited from WordPress, either the CMS or the community, to contribute up to 5 percent of their resources to the continued success of the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:03] <strong>Hari:</strong> In 2019, this idea was formalized as a program with a pledging page that lives in the URL WordPress.org/five. Right now, this program attempts to foster generous collaboration towards the long-term health and stability of our project for the future. So, like any large and successful open source project, WordPress has a lot of big goals and tasks, not all of which can be accomplished by volunteers in that available time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where sponsored contributors come in. Sponsored contributors have more time, availability, and bandwidth to make an impact on a lot of these tasks. They also work on some routine but important administrative and housekeeping tasks that are essential to keep the project running smoothly. At this time, the program has 868 contributors from 183 companies, who have pledged 7,722 hours of contribution time per week for the program. I can also share that roughly 70% of contribution activity in WordPress is coming from these sponsored contributors. That is the Five for the Future program in brief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:15] <strong>Angela:</strong> Thanks, Hari. That&#8217;s incredible that so much of our contribution comes through sponsored time and clearly is very necessary to keep the WordPress open source project running. Wonderful. All right, well, I would love to dig into the Contributor Mentorship Program. Can you tell us a bit more about how this came to be? What is the Contributor Mentorship Program?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:41] <strong>Hari:</strong> Oh, absolutely. It is one of my favorite programs and one of the best things that I&#8217;ve worked on personally. So, the Contributor Mentorship Program aims to onboard new contributors to WordPress by providing them one-on-one and cohort-based mentorship for a period of typically four to six weeks. The mentorship program typically coincides a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] <strong>Hari:</strong> And the idea behind the program is to help new contributors kickstart their WordPress contributor journey by providing them an in-depth overview of the WordPress project as well. To talk a bit about how this started, it all began in 2022-2023 when I started researching on the WordPress contributor experience. I discovered that there were gaps in the onboarding experience for new contributors. And I did some research on how we can solve this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, while those gaps can be fixed by improving the overall WordPress contributor onboarding experience through technical changes or changes in the program. Mentorship really stood out as an excellent solution to solve the problem. Based on my discovery from this research, I worked on revitalizing the WordPress Contributor Working Group of the Community Team. And together, our group we started working on building a mentorship program. We did a few months of collaborative discussions and brainstorming. And as a result, the group put together the idea for a pilot cohort-based mentorship program, which paired up 13 new contributors as mentees with one mentor each. The cohort worked together for four weeks, and 11 of these mentees graduated after making impactful contributions to the project, with over half of the cohort staying on to make long-term contributions. In fact, we just wrapped up the second cohort of the program in February 2024, which had 52 participants, of which 44 graduated from the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:34] <strong>Angela:</strong> Amazing. Congratulations. And I speaking just for myself, I know how important mentorship was to, to a lot of my journeys, both within WordPress and outside of, and so I think it&#8217;s wonderful that we&#8217;re able to bring mentorship to this space. What sort of benefits are there to participating in this program, either as a new WordPress contributor or as a mentor?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:04] <strong>Hari:</strong> There&#8217;s a bunch of benefits for both new contributors and mentors in this program, starting with new contributors. First and foremost, new participants in this program they get to kick off their WordPress contributor journey by making initial contributions. So, in my mind, the biggest benefit that they get is they get a chance to actually make their first contributions in the area of their choice with help from a mentor. The other main benefit that I see is that these mentees or new contributors. They get to learn a lot about the WordPress project and how it works. They get to learn about the WordPress release process broadly. And in short, participants in this program also get a chance to network with and learn from experienced WordPress contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this program is a great opportunity for mentees or new contributors to pick up a lot of valuable skills that they can use in the real world. For mentors, they also get a lot of benefits from this program. In fact, to share another anecdote, some of our mentors they contributed for the first time to WordPress core in the last cohort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:14] <strong>Hari:</strong> So, that is also something that they also get to learn, which means mentors also get to learn new skills when they be a part of this program. So, for mentors, even they get to enhance their skills, they get to expand the network within the WordPress community, but in my mind, the biggest benefit that they gain is they gain fulfillment from guiding new contributors. And personally, as a mentor myself, it&#8217;s one of the most valuable thing that you can gain from such a program. That feeling of belonging, that feeling of, you know, fostering sustainability and innovation in the project. I also feel that mentoring new contributors is a great way to bolster your leadership and communication skills, which is extremely valuable in any professional context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:54] <strong>Angela:</strong> Absolutely. I definitely see that being able to share your experience and mentor others is a really valuable way to help the next generation of WordPressers be successful in our space. Now, you&#8217;ve talked a bit about what results you&#8217;re seeing from this program, and it&#8217;s really exciting to see that so many mentees are successfully graduating from this program. I&#8217;d love to hear more about the impact and results that you&#8217;re seeing from the mentorship program. Could you give us more details there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Hari:</strong> Absolutely. So, I shared some numbers earlier. We had 11 mentees out of 13 graduating from the 2023 cohort and 44 outta 52 mentees from the 2024 Q1 cohort graduating. From the first cohort we have six of these mentees continuing to make impactful contributions to the project, but we have more encouraging results from the second cohort, in fact. So, ten of our mentees in the second cohort got props for contributing to WordPress 6.5, and one of our mentees was a noteworthy contributor. That&#8217;s about 22% of all the mentees. Fourteen mentees from the latest cohort, which is 31%, they have committed to join the WordPress 6.6 release squad. And the program actually gave eight new core contributors to the project, which includes mentors, as I mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:21] <strong>Hari:</strong> We did pre and post-cohort surveys, and the results are very interesting. I can definitely share some numbers here. So, we had a question on contributor familiarity. The familiarity of contribution for new contributors went up from 53% to 80%, that&#8217;s around 26% increase. The contribution confidence went from 57% to 82%, which is around 28%-29%. We asked if the mentees how many of these mentees were satisfied by the program. We heard that 88% of all the mentees were satisfied. 80% of mentees achieved their personal goals as part of the program. A key part of the program experience was that we asked mentees to create contribution plans to make future contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:06] <strong>Hari:</strong> 62% of our mentees actually made a future contribution plan. So which means, which is a 30, 60, 90-day plan. So, these mentees they&#8217;re gonna follow a plan to contribute to WordPress for the next three months. Finally, we also created a ton of learning materials for these mentees, and we are in the process of releasing them. So these are, most of these are videos, so we plan to release them in WordPress or TV and in the Learn WordPress platform. So, in my mind, seeing these mentees out in the world making impactful contributions that is the biggest impact that I&#8217;m seeing. So, having them in the project as long-term contributors. That is, in my mind, one of the biggest impacts that we&#8217;ve had from this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:46] <strong>Angela:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really incredible to see that new contributors to WordPress, upon joining this program, able to better navigate this vast ecosystem and make important contributions to our space. And that they&#8217;ve made these connections, so they are sticking around and staying with us and continuing to help us build WordPress. That&#8217;s incredible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:14] <strong>Angela:</strong> Now, I understand that between the first cohort and the second cohort, the Contributor Working Group made some important updates and iterated on the cohort itself. And one of the big changes, I understand, was to design cohorts around contributor projects. I&#8217;m curious now that we&#8217;ve talked about how fantastic this program is. Are there plans for future cohorts, and what might those cohorts look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:44] <strong>Hari:</strong> Absolutely. So, we have received a lot of interest in future cohorts. So, our working group just did a chat last week, and there was overwhelming positive interest and from all our working group members and other participants saying that we would love to be in a future cohort. So, short answer, yes, we will have a ton of these cohorts going forward. And we are, in fact, hosting a new cohort alongside WordPress 6.7. In October-November, 2024. And we will most likely continue to host at least one mentorship cohort every year. Ideally two, but I&#8217;m just saying one to make sure that we are sustainable. It is hard to predict how future cohorts will look like, but based on all the discussions our working group has had, I can definitely tell you how the next cohort is going to look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:35] <strong>Hari:</strong> So, as per current plans, we will have around 20 to 30 mentees supported by mentors. And the cohort will most likely start early on in the 6.7 release process. The idea is that we would like our mentees to be more deeply involved in the 6.7 release as early as possible. We also plan to have a lot more learn-up sessions in the next cohort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One feedback that we heard was our mentees really enjoyed some of the learn-up sessions, and they would like these sessions to be scheduled in advance as much as possible so that they can attend as many of them as possible. So, more learn-up sessions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:14] <strong>Hari:</strong> And finally, you mentioned projects when you spoke of the latest cohort. We are going to double down on projects in the next cohort. So the hope is to have a host of projects for folks to work on and, ideally, have all mentees work on some project or the other. So, we had projects as an experiment for the earlier cohort. Some mentees did work on projects, while some they were broadly contributing. So, ideally, for the next cohort, every mentee in the program will be a part of some project or the other. It could be a small one. It could be a big one, but there will be some project of some sort for every mentee in the program, ideally. And finally, some contributors in our cohort, they received a scholarship to participate in the last cohort. We hope to expand that. We hope to provide more opportunities for scholarship for contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:05] <strong>Hari:</strong> I&#8217;m not sure how viable it is, but we did see that the folks who received scholarship, they got a chance to contribute more. So we would ideally like to provide more opportunities for scholarship, especially for folks from underrepresented backgrounds, so that they can contribute to WordPress and, you know, upskill as part of this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Angela:</strong> Fantastic. Well, hopefully, we have convinced our listeners today to get involved in the Contributor Mentorship Program. And so, if somebody wanted to get involved, either as a mentee or a mentor, how should they go about doing so?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] <strong>Hari:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. We have not opened up signups for mentors and mentees for the next cohort yet. As I mentioned, it&#8217;s going to happen later this year. However, those interested in the next cohort of the program can comment on the post. I think we can share the link in the show notes. We just published a post announcing the graduation of our mentees, and we had asked folks who are interested in joining the next cohort comment there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:07] <strong>Hari:</strong> So if you&#8217;re interested in joining the next cohort, either as a mentor or a mentee. You can comment on that post. Alternatively, you can also DM me. If you&#8217;re not comfortable commenting in a public space, my name is Hari Shanker. I am Hari Shanker, which is H-A-R-I-S-H-A-N-K-E-R. That&#8217;s my username in the Make WordPress Slack. You can DM me there expressing your interest, and I will make sure that we send you the call for interest form when it&#8217;s published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, and this is especially to all the mentor applicants, we have a Contributor Working Group, which meets every third Thursday of the month in the Community Team channel on a text chat. It&#8217;s called a mentorship chat. It happens every month, and you can find a link to it in the Make WordPress meetings, P2 blog. So, if you&#8217;re interested in being a mentor, or if you&#8217;re interested in building the Contributor Mentorship Program, or contributing to the Contributor Mentorship Program, I would invite you to join our chat. So, the next chat is being held in May. Please join our next chat. That&#8217;s also a great way to contribute to this program, especially if you are interested in being a mentor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:10] <strong>Angela:</strong> Wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me today, Hari. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:16] <strong>Hari:</strong> Thank you. It&#8217;s been an honor, and thank you for inviting me to be a part of this program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:19]&nbsp;(Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:27] <strong>Angela:</strong> And now it is time for our small list of big things. We&#8217;ve got three things for you this week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is a proposal to explore the Support Team contributor ladder. If you are not familiar with the concept of the contributor ladder, it is based on the five stages of volunteering, which examines how a volunteer gets onboarded and steps into progressive roles. By thinking through the contributor ladder, Make WordPress teams are able to improve onboarding, engagement, and connection with contributors and generally improve the health of their team. If this is of interest to you, we have a great overview post about the contributor ladder, and you can see the discussion in action over on the Support Team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:14] <strong>Angela:</strong> Second, is that the WordPress Foundation has just announced the Kim Parcell Memorial Scholarship for 2024. This scholarship is in honor of Kim Parcell, an incredible long-time contributor, and is awarded to a current WordPress contributor who is a woman, has not previously attended WordCamp US, and requires financial assistance to attend this year&#8217;s event.&nbsp;The scholarship will provide travel assistance for the recipient to attend WordCamp US this year in Portland, Oregon, and covers travel from your home city, hotel, and your ticket to the event. The application is open through May 30th, and you can apply on the WordPress Foundation page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third is a reminder of our next big WordPress event, WordCamp Europe, which will be in beautiful Torino, Italy, June 13th through the 15th. You can still get tickets on their website. If you can&#8217;t make it to Italy, never fear. This time of year sees a good number of WordPress events around the world, and they are a great way to connect with WordPress friends and hear all about the latest and greatest in WordPress. You can go find upcoming events on events.WordPress.org to see what events are happening in your area. If there isn&#8217;t a WordPress event near you, you can become an organizer and start hosting events locally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:42] <strong>Angela:</strong> And that, friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app. Or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser, or if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those by emailing WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your guest host, Angela Jin. Thanks so much for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. In a couple of weeks, Josepha will be back as your regular host for the next episode.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:21] (Music outro)&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"Do The Woo Community: A Comunidade Portugal do WordPress – The Portugal WordPress Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=83262\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-comunidade-portugal-do-wordpress-the-portugal-wordpress-community/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:148:\"No nosso programa Vozes da Comunidade, WordPress pelo Mundo, destacamos a comunidade WordPress de Portugal para uma conversa na sua língua materna.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 08:15:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Gravatar: Revamping User Authentication: The Role of Passkeys\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1366\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/26/revamping-user-authentication-the-role-of-passkeys/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15038:\"<p>Passkeys are leading the charge in transforming how we secure our digital identities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article offers a comprehensive exploration of passkeys – breaking down their mechanics, illustrating their advantages over traditional passwords, and showcasing their role in the next wave of secure online authentication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a developer, IT professional, or simply tech-curious, join us as we explore the ins and outs of passkeys, providing practical examples and guidance on how to implement them for a safer, smoother online experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are passkeys?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A passkey is a secure method that distinctly identifies a user through advanced mechanisms that go beyond the traditional “something you know” attribute of passwords. Instead, passkeys encompass facets like “something you are”, like biometrics, or “something you have”, such as a physical security key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/mJ-N_j8Rr3Kta7O0S1DPWe0hisuvejqbUimVJUxf6QqdNMVvbEEaURvRXrm342DaXsuKk8ce9AZBJs05gXVDUrN5tzDUJ0-2oGcoR6tJ98YNeS1jc63lCtOmY0FQaFyK-9JYAbF-uiPGN406xgZUwGU\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example of biometric authentication</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using passkeys for your websites and platforms gives visitors an easy way to verify their identity without typing complex passwords, replacing them with unique and often temporary credentials, enhancing security and user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tokens often come in the form of unique, time-sensitive codes that protect online spaces against unwanted entries. The most common types include facial and fingerprint recognition, complicated designed patterns, or secure PINs, which are often specially generated for this specific login attempt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many advantages to integrating passkeys:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced security: </strong>Passkeys offer a more secure authentication method compared to traditional passwords, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User-friendly: </strong>They simplify the login process, making it quicker and more convenient for users by eliminating the need to remember and type passwords.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduced forgetfulness issues: </strong>The temporary nature of passkeys means users don&#8217;t have to remember a static password, decreasing the chances of lockouts due to forgotten passwords.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Resistance to brute force attacks:</strong> Passkeys&#8217; unique and often temporary nature makes them much harder for attackers to guess through repeated trial and error.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Decreased dependency on password recovery: </strong>Passkeys significantly reduce the reliance on potentially insecure password recovery methods, as users no longer need to reset forgotten passwords frequently.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Passkeys are built on FIDO standards</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>​​Short for Fast Identity Online, <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/\">FIDO is a global authentication standard</a> designed to reinforce and simplify the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">digital authentication process</a>, making it simpler for users and more secure against threats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These standards are based on public key cryptography and have played a crucial role in encouraging the adoption of passkeys by ensuring they comply with rigorous security and ease-of-use criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the integration of FIDO protocols, such as <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/specs/u2f-specs-master/fido-u2f-overview.html\">U2F (Universal 2nd Factor)</a> and <a href=\"https://webauthn.io/\">WebAuthn</a>, passkeys benefit from an advanced security infrastructure. U2F adds a layer of protection by involving a physical security key in the authentication process, while WebAuthn allows for the registration and verification of users on web applications through biometric data, mobile devices, or FIDO security keys, moving away from password reliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination of passkeys with FIDO standards has significantly improved digital authentication, making it safer and more user-friendly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the user flow with passkeys</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys are revolutionizing the way we authenticate, making logging in smoother and more secure. Imagine the ease of entering a secure system or website without the hassle of remembering complex passwords. Here&#8217;s a simple breakdown of how a typical passkey authentication process works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Registration: </strong>First, a user chooses to create a passkey for a service. This often happens during the initial sign-up or through a settings menu for existing users. The user confirms their identity through a verification method, like an email link or a text message code.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Creating a passkey: </strong>The system prompts the user to authorize the creation of a passkey. This can be done using a device&#8217;s biometric features (like a fingerprint or facial recognition) or a PIN. The passkey is then generated and securely stored on the user&#8217;s device, as well as with the service, but in a way that the service can&#8217;t see the passkey itself.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> When returning to the service, the user is prompted to unlock their passkey, again using biometrics or a PIN. The device then communicates with the service, confirming the user’s identity without transmitting the passkey. This seamless interaction ensures that the user&#8217;s credentials are never exposed to potential theft.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/h-3BYhKjAzHzS7m2CRR052HrW-uSCLfW3eq3yuOBTOKOERTvaDgYpP6_DkkRcf4XV3a8297IjTP6_rVix8LoMDLp3yO-GJb7z4XVyjRxUoKDpGMlybjbSiOiQnWHPCrOikaHtJlKqkxHcz-cQhxr9Wk\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>How passkey authentication works</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Cross-device usage: </strong>Passkeys can also be used across different devices, thanks to cloud synchronization, making authentication even more convenient without compromising security.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This flow stands out from traditional passwords by eliminating the need for users to remember anything or enter credentials manually, reducing the risk of phishing or password theft. Besides that, because the authentication is tied to the user&#8217;s device and/or biometrics, it significantly enhances security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploring real-world examples of the Passkeys experience</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>iOS, Android, and desktop recognition&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On mobile platforms like <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.android.com/\">Android</a>, the experience of using passkeys is designed to be incredibly intuitive. When users attempt to log into a service that supports passkeys, the operating system prompts them to authenticate using a method they are already familiar with, such as a fingerprint, facial recognition, or a PIN.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of modern laptops, both <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows\">Windows</a>, include a fingerprint scanner in the power button, and since 2015, Windows laptops have started including facial recognition, as well. Until a few years ago, this was a function only available for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this is how the prompt looks on a Mac laptop when trying to access information behind a security wall, such as the <a href=\"https://passwords.google.com/\">Google Password Manager</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GZlGyRgyu3PrBnsgE5crkCM3Kk4HU6B2_a35zOEDRaEgd85wDYjTpmqT8D-pwSJyMgelVRpb7rFIcKWJMcTHu-y-sMk9hYHzqB3HtL_WYsCP2_98CDtFAI_Uax15ZHJkkV0EeJ7aOuV4npax5rKz-pM\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Touch ID option on a Mac computer</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the device&#8217;s settings, people can specify where they want to use this type of recognition.

Users can <a href=\"https://www.google.com/account/about/passkeys/\">create a passkey for their Google Account</a>, which then allows for swift access to <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive</a>, and other Google services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why developers, users, and businesses prefer passkeys over passwords and MFA&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past few years, more and more developers and businesses prefer passkeys over traditional passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Let’s see why.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>They&#8217;re safer</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional systems are very vulnerable. For example, in 2021, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/18/nyregion/nyc-law-department-hack.html\">the New York City Law Department experienced a significant cyberattack</a>, where attackers accessed sensitive data, including city employees&#8217; personal information, police misconduct evidence, plaintiffs&#8217; medical records, and the identities of minors charged with crimes, through a single employee&#8217;s compromised email password.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys, on the other hand, are immune to common threats like phishing and keylogging, as they do not transmit sensitive information that can be intercepted or deceitfully obtained.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is possible because passkeys use public-private key cryptography, a method far superior to the conventional password system. Unlike passwords, which rely on a shared secret known by both the user and the service, passkeys work by creating a pair of keys: a private one that stays with the user and a public one stored on the server. So, even if a server is compromised, attackers cannot impersonate the user without access to the private key.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>They’re easier to use</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys significantly simplify the user experience. People don’t need to remember complex passwords, manage multiple credentials, and constantly reset passwords.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they gain access with just a tap or a biometric check, making the process not only quicker but also more enjoyable. This simplicity and speed appeal to tech-savvy individuals and those less comfortable with technology, expanding the accessibility of secure online services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>They result in more conversions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The frictionless nature of passkey authentication reduces dropout rates during the signup process and encourages higher user retention by removing common login-related frustrations. This ease of use can significantly boost conversion rates, as users are more likely to complete sign-up processes and continue using services that offer an effortless access method.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, by adopting passkeys, companies can distinguish themselves from competitors, offering a modern and secure authentication solution that appeals to privacy and convenience-conscious consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>They can be used for single sign-on purposes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys seamlessly integrate with Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions, enhancing both convenience and security. SSO allows users to access multiple services or applications with a single set of credentials, reducing the burden of remembering numerous passwords.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By incorporating passkeys into SSO frameworks, users enjoy an even smoother login experience across various platforms, with the added benefit of heightened security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This integration not only simplifies user access but also bolsters productivity and security for businesses by minimizing the potential attack surface for cyber threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It’s time to enter a passwordless future</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this article, you’ll have understood what passkeys are – and more importantly, you’ll hopefully agree that it’s time for passkeys to trump passwords once and for all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, we’re paving the way for a more open, connected, and user-centric internet – and our approach to profile management lets you build a complete digital identity management solution along with your passkeys authentication service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more than 20 years of serving as people’s globally recognized avatar, Gravatar allows users to create profiles that serve as universal identifiers across any website or web application that integrates with Gravatar’s API. This minimizes the need for users to manage data across different platforms and also minimizes the need for you as a developer or website owner to store user data directly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you’re looking to enhance your site, app, or online store, <a href=\"http://docs.gravatar.com\">discover more about how you can integrate Gravatar</a> and join the movement toward a more secure, efficient online experience for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 17:09:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"Do The Woo Community: Valkey Taking Over Redis and Open Source Funding with Robert and Courtney\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=83090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://dothewoo.io/valkey-taking-over-redis-and-open-source-funding-with-robert-and-courtney/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"Robert and Courtney discuss open source events, licensing changes in Redis, and the need for sustainable funding.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 09:15:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: #117 – Maestro Stevens on Inclusivity in Website Design Decisions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=155507\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/117-maestro-stevens-on-inclusivity-in-website-design-decisions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35766:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern.

And you can copy that URL in to most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Maestro Stevens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro is an international speaker and managing director of The Iconic Expressions. His areas of expertise include digital marketing, brand strategy, web development, and project leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Maestro lays out the case for how inclusivity is not just something that we need to be concerned about at things like events, but also in our WordPress website designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro recently gave a presentation at WordCamp Asia entitled unlocking universal creativity, the future of inclusive WordPress design. He wants to get people to think about making design choices with inclusivity in mind so that they&#8217;re representative of various cultures and varied backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro reveals the challenges and the pushback he is faced on his journey, telling us about the struggles and support he&#8217;s found within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His approach includes utilizing AI to create unique imagery, reflective of a diverse population, and how he sees this as something new in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion also gets into the practical side as well, with Maestro outlining some of the technical aspects and future plans for his ideas, extending an open invitation to listeners who wish to contribute or learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you curious about the intersection of creativity, representation, and the WordPress ecosystem, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note, before we begin, this was recorded live at WordCamp Asia. There was quite a lot of background noise to contend with, and I&#8217;ve done my best to make the audio as easy to listen to as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Maestro Stevens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Maestro Stevens. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:16] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> I&#8217;m doing great. I&#8217;m doing excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very nice to have you with us. We&#8217;re at WordCamp Asia. We&#8217;re in the venue. Maestro is joining me on the second day of the conference, so it&#8217;s the third day, including contributor day. You&#8217;ve already done your presentation, which I think you did yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Yes I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It was entitled Unlocking Universal Creativity, the Future of Inclusive WordPress Design. We&#8217;re going to get into that, and have a conversation around that subject in a moment. Before we do that, Maestro, will you just spend a minute telling us who you are, and what your WordPress journey is, your relationship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:52] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> And all I have is a minute, Nathan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just one minute. Just a minute. The clock starts, no. As long as you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Well, first of all, thank you for having me again. This is an honor. And for us to be in person is another honor. As you mentioned, my name is Maestro Stevens, the fresh prince of WordPress. And my whole goal is bringing a fresh perspective to those who have a misunderstanding of what WordPress is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my spare time, I love to cook. I used to be a chef, in another life. I have a daughter. I love technology. I love creating opportunities. I love creating dreams for people, bringing people to WordCamp for the first time. That&#8217;s my spiel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s really nice, and you&#8217;ve missed out something, which is that you&#8217;re also really into audio. And we spent a good 10 minutes before we hit record, just obsessing about the equipment that we&#8217;ve got. Which, as you can probably hear, dear listener, is not as good as it could be. But it&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got. It&#8217;s portable, and it will do the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So tell us about the talk. Give us the nitty gritty on why you chose that title. What was it all about? And we&#8217;ll have a journey, a conversation, and dig into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:58] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Yeah. Well, I got a confession to make. The title is a little bit of a hook. You know, it&#8217;s nothing new that we don&#8217;t do. However, it&#8217;s still authentic, in as far as the presentation is concerned, mainly because I wanted to bridge the gap with helping people understand that, when it comes to diverse creators, people from ethnic backgrounds or different backgrounds, such as WordCamp Asia, that accessibility can be used interchangeably with the word inclusivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because when you are making things accessible, you&#8217;re saying, I want to include others. And sometimes we separate those two terminologies. They have different meanings, but they are cousins or, you know, family related. So I really wanted to help people understand that our platform, Iconic Templates, which is what I was talking about yesterday, is a platform created for those who want to be included, and need to access certain tools and solutions, that typically would normally not have access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What you&#8217;ve just described, is this something that you find important on a personal level? Is this a journey, not just in the WordPress space? Is this something that you, I was going to use the word preach, but that&#8217;s the wrong word, adjacent to preach. Is this something that you talk about in other spheres as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:05] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Yes. I would say, well, one, to answer your question, it is a passion of mine. I ran into a lot of issues myself. I think us business owners, and entrepreneurs, and creators, a lot of the problems that we solve for others, stem from us. And something that I would say I did not see a lot of, when I was looking at something as templates on the internet, and I&#8217;m not going to point out any particular company but, you know, there&#8217;s just a lot of templates that I saw, that didn&#8217;t have imagery and representation that reminded me of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I know it&#8217;s controversial, because I&#8217;ve got some backlash from this in certain communities. People are just going to take the content out anyway. They&#8217;re going to replace the images and replace the things. But the reality is, people want to see them. They want to hear them. They want to know that the company, that&#8217;s creating tools for them, thought of them in mind. Hey, we&#8217;re going to make this thing, and then we&#8217;re going to slap on some stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas, we&#8217;ve created everything. We&#8217;ve created with certain cultures, and certain industries in mind. From not just the imagery and the content, but even the structure and the layout. So we are coming from the forefront, and not the aftermath of adding others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds, from what you just said, as if there&#8217;s been a little bit of pushback from certain people. Is that the minority? Do you find WordPress, as a community, I mean obviously that&#8217;s a bit of an umbrella phrase, and you know, it&#8217;s made of millions and millions of different people. But, do you find the WordPress community, on the whole, receptive to what you are saying? Or is it more a case of, you are having to push back, and explain yourself over and over again, and being challenged and pushing back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Well, Nathan, yes. I&#8217;ve been challenged a lot. To be transparent with you, when we launched a year and a half ago with this platform, inside of a couple communities, very small, we had good reception only because I made an adjustment, because I got scared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing that happened, when I said I&#8217;m going to create this platform for diverse creators and BIPOC communities, people, for lack of a better term, did not like that. They gave me a lot of negative feedback. So what I did is I said, okay, well let&#8217;s create the platform for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spoke at WordCamp Europe. Then I spoke at WordCamp US. Now I&#8217;m here speaking at WordCamp Asia. And I realised that there are a lot of people that do want to see, I would say the type of, not product, but the type of solutions, and the type of representation. But I had to meet these people in real life, and I had to learn my tribe. And every WordPress community is not your tribe, even if they, quote unquote, liked your product before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you get a sense that this is a case of the quiet majority who don&#8217;t speak up to support what you are doing? Do you get that feeling? Because it sounds like, when you&#8217;ve come to these events, you have met kindred spirits, people who are aligned with what you are aligned with, but you had to go and find them. Which kind of tells me they were always there in the first place, but they didn&#8217;t let you know that they were there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So is it a case of that? You know, people just keeping quiet and putting their head under the parapet, to dodge the proverbial arrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:02] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a little bit of all that. And it&#8217;s crazy that I&#8217;m learning how to, I don&#8217;t want to say play the game, but be careful on the things that I say, because I can be very outspoken at times. That&#8217;s a gift and a curse, in some ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that being said, I do think that it is, when you say the word minority and majority, there are people that are afraid to speak up, and there are people who don&#8217;t want to speak up, because it will ruin their opportunities and their, what they&#8217;ve gained, I guess, growing in the ladder of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there&#8217;s gatekeepers in WordPress. You know, there&#8217;s people that you have to appease in certain ways. And there&#8217;s people that don&#8217;t want to hear your voice all the time. So I do think, to your point, when you think about it, the majority versus the minority, it&#8217;s a little bit of all. But I do think there&#8217;s a lot of people who are afraid to say something, and there&#8217;s people who don&#8217;t want to say something, because they don&#8217;t want to ruin what they have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That sort of feels a bit upsetting really though, doesn&#8217;t it? On some level, it feels like that&#8217;s a bit of a shame. But you&#8217;re right. We definitely have some strong characters in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you talking about being online? So in, you know, groups, on various different platforms. Is it that kind of community that you&#8217;ve been involved in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, okay. And there are some definite characters, aren&#8217;t there? And some people who have fairly loud voices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:14] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So you&#8217;ve made the effort to come out and speak about these things. At these events, have you felt that you&#8217;ve had a nice reception? Has it been a different experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:24] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Good question. I would say, not to be redundant, but a little bit of both. Going to WordCamp Europe was an eyeopener. Athens, Greece, I mean, well, one, not a lot of people that live there that look like me. I stood out immediately, just from that perspective. And then actually going to WordCamp itself, where we&#8217;re told that they are looking at it from an inclusive lens and, you know, we want to involve everybody, make everybody feel comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I actually got in the venue, in the building, I thought that the stares were going to stop. You know, I thought that the looks were going to stop, and they didn&#8217;t all stop. And that&#8217;s not everybody, but it was quite obvious, and quite a few. But I will definitely say, when I did my presentation, those people who joined the presentation showed love. When I did a presentation yesterday, those who joined showed love. I&#8217;ve been seeing random people say, hey man, I saw your presentation yesterday. I didn&#8217;t even know they did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I got way more questions than I ever would&#8217;ve thought I would&#8217;ve gotten, because people were like, oh, he&#8217;s not afraid to talk about this. And so they&#8217;re raising their hands and they&#8217;re saying, well, what do I do? I&#8217;m hearing that from people from all across the world. And I love that. So that, to me, is what sticks out more than anything. The rest of the nonsense, for lack of a better term, I&#8217;m striving to kind of let that go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you feel safe in these spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:38] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s not an immediate yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:41] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> No, it&#8217;s not immediate yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I mean, we don&#8217;t have to go down that path if you don&#8217;t wish to. But I am curious, because we are quite good as a community at congratulating ourselves, on how accommodating we are. And we definitely have people, and I know that you know many of the people that I&#8217;m not going to name, but you probably will intuit who I&#8217;m talking about, who fight this fight, and they make the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is interesting to me that despite all of that, there&#8217;s still, it sounds like considerable amounts of work to be done. The example of WordCamp Athens that you&#8217;ve just described, that doesn&#8217;t sound like a particularly pleasant experience that you had there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:19] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> I&#8217;m grateful that I had the opportunity to even go. That changed my life. I encourage anybody who is thinking of getting a different perspective of life in the world, it doesn&#8217;t matter what kind of pushback or resistance that you get, travel. Travel to places that you would&#8217;ve never been before. Even if you&#8217;re going to get looked at, and stared at, and feel uncomfortable, because you&#8217;ll learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, which will give you a different perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to your point, and going back to the whole safety aspect of things, I would say I don&#8217;t always feel the safety net that I would love to be able to speak up. I will say that, for the most part, going to Athens, Greece, as an example, it reminded me of WordPress is also a reflection of the world too, to a degree. We still have some work to do in the world, you know, everywhere. And WordPress is doing what it can to help mitigate that. But I do think, to your point, there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just really quickly, I&#8217;ve called out some founders. And when it came to certain issues or certain things, to help support me and back me up, and I&#8217;ve noticed that they&#8217;ve chose profit over passion, you know, over mission. And the funny part is, the data shows, because I&#8217;m a data analyst, you know, I have an agency as well too. Data shows that most people, they want to purchase, and they want to deal with brands that actually are mission based. How ironic is that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind of a catch 22 that, you know, there&#8217;s these founders that don&#8217;t want to touch certain issues. Most people purchase based on, is there a mission, a value, the reasons? They&#8217;re not just purchasing on quality, you know, things like that. It&#8217;s, who is behind it? Why are they doing it? What are they doing it for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting, I often end up at the about page, soon after I&#8217;ve gone to the pricing page, because I do want to know about the company that I&#8217;m buying the plugin, or whatever it may be. And it, yeah, it does play a certain part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to ask this question. Feel free to ignore it, because I don&#8217;t know what pitfalls there may be inside this. Does geography play a part in this? Do you find that you can have this conversation more easily at home, for example, in the US? Is it a conversation that&#8217;s being more advanced, more acceptable to have, more straightforward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve obviously mentioned Europe, we&#8217;ve got Asia, there&#8217;s different complexities. They&#8217;ve obviously got their own things going on. But, do you notice that geography plays a part in this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:36] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Yes, I think so. And I had some conversations today with a couple other founders from East Asia, and it was great to hear that I&#8217;m, they&#8217;re from a different country and different culture. They&#8217;re saying they find the same issues. I&#8217;m like, so I&#8217;m not crazy. You know, it&#8217;s not an American thing, you know what I mean? It&#8217;s not a US thing. It&#8217;s an everywhere thing, and global positioning does play a part in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I am grateful that WordPress has people like yourself, and people that are, I would consider allied. Creating platforms where people like me can talk, and speak about these issues, because otherwise people are normally just trying to kind of suppress the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting, isn&#8217;t it? Because, we&#8217;ve talked for probably about 15 minutes so far, and it feels like we might have been being very negative, but I&#8217;m not feeling that really. I&#8217;m feeling more like there&#8217;s a lot of goodness in the WordPress community, but no community is a hundred percent perfect, and there&#8217;s work to be done. And you have had experiences which are real. They happen, they existed. You&#8217;ve talked to these people, and you&#8217;ve got these receptions, so it needs to be addressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your product, you&#8217;ve said, tries to address this. And I&#8217;m curious as to how templates, parts of a website, how we can map the conversation that we&#8217;ve just had, over to a product. So tell me about that. I mean, you alluded to it a little while ago, but just really flesh out what Iconic Templates is, and what it does, and why it&#8217;s different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:04] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> I love this question, because it helps give me a different perspective of, how do I define it? And I&#8217;m learning, you know, based on the reception. I would say, for the most part, our goal with Iconic Templates, and this is the reason why some of our product lines have the word universal in them. For example, universal template themes, universal template library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that a big problem in the WordPress ecosystem, and in other ecosystems, is that a person says, hey, I like that look. I like that style, but I don&#8217;t use that tool. And so what we are trying to do, striving to do, because Yoda says, you do or you don&#8217;t, there is no try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;re striving to do is bridge that gap for people to say, you&#8217;ve made a style or a look that fits me. Whatever it is they do, whatever industry, vertical they&#8217;re in, whatever ethnic background they have. And they&#8217;re like, but I use the classic editor still, I don&#8217;t use full site, or I use the page builder. Do you have that look and that style in the page builder that I use? Do you have that look and that style with a plugin that I use? You know, there&#8217;s email plugins, there&#8217;s form plugins, there&#8217;s automation plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;re striving to do with Iconic Templates is create this universal tether. An ecosystem where you&#8217;re saying, I like that look and that style, but I may want to use this plugin versus this plugin. I want to use this theme versus that theme, but I want to keep the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, if we were to go to iconictemplates.com, and we were to look at your, I&#8217;m going to use the word library, because I think you said that, your library of patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:34] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> So for instance, we have a library called Uni-Blocks. And so our Uni-Blocks library is block patterns. Keep it short and simple. Our Uni-Blocks library currently is created with Kadence Blocks, for example. So our next step would be creating it with Elementor widgets or Spectra, for example. That&#8217;s pretty much what we&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What would I be seeing? I&#8217;m imagining I&#8217;m on the website, I know we&#8217;re doing audio, so it&#8217;s very hard to do this. Bear with us, we&#8217;ll try and get there. What would I be seeing that would be different from what I might see elsewhere? How would you explain the visual difference of what I might see with what you&#8217;ve got, than what other companies bring to bear?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:12] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Well, one, you&#8217;re going to see a lot of imagery of black and brown people, and people from other ethnic backgrounds. You&#8217;re going to see a lot of that. Two, you&#8217;re going to see a little bit of, we&#8217;ll say nerdiness, geekiness, mixes with cool, intentionally mixed with some coolness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a background where, I love Hip-Hop. I haven&#8217;t seen anybody infuse Hip-Hop into their template platform. So when you go on our platform, you&#8217;re going to see these backgrounds. I said this in my presentation yesterday, one of my favorite artists is Jay-Z. And when we first started the platform, I didn&#8217;t know who I was. So we made our color scheme with a whole bunch of colors, all over the rainbow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can&#8217;t make this up, one day this is going to be a famous story, but it was a reflection of who I was. I didn&#8217;t have my identity intact, so our company and our brand didn&#8217;t have its identity intact. It came to me in an epiphany, in a eureka moment. I was working with my designer Dessa, and she needed more inspiration from me, on how to create this design, or layout for our site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was stuck. I had a dream. I was like, man, who&#8217;s my favorite artist? Oh, Jay-Z. What album did he make that&#8217;s one of my favorite albums? The Blueprint. Aren&#8217;t templates blueprints, aren&#8217;t we as people, blueprints? So then I was like, oh, it&#8217;s blue, and the color of blue is solidarity. There&#8217;s meanings behind blue. And most companies use blue. You know, a lot of tech companies use blue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I said, what is the odds of that? That tech companies use blue, one of my favorite artists has an album called The Blueprint, and we are blueprints for others. So when you go to our website, you&#8217;re going to see a blue background with little templates. And that was inspired by Jay-Z&#8217;s album, The Blueprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And so, you mentioned the imagery is a big part. You&#8217;re differentiating yourself by going out, and deliberately finding images, which represent the entire world. Does it also stretch to text? Are you surfacing text that you think is aligned in this way as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:02] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Well, Nathan, here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m going to blow your mind here. One of our big value propositions, or values, is transparency. So, I say our process is a template, our website is a template, and we offer templates. What do I mean by that? Everything we&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve intentionally done in a way that can be duplicated for others. We&#8217;re going to teach from that. The process is a template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People can go to our website, and literally look at our website and say, I want to copy what you&#8217;ve done. And what most people don&#8217;t know is, every image you&#8217;re going to see, is made with AI. We do a lot of experimentation. So we use Midjourney, for example. So you said the word find, no, we didn&#8217;t find, we created, generated, based on words, based on the text. So there&#8217;s not a single image on that website that you will see, that you will find anywhere else, in any stock library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right. So it&#8217;s unique. It isn&#8217;t from a stock library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:50] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How has the platform launched? Since the moment you went public with it, and you&#8217;ve put it out there, how has the reception been? I mean, I&#8217;m guessing by the fact that you are here in WordCamp Asia, and obviously are making a living out of this in some way, shape, or form, it must be going all right. But I don&#8217;t know, you tell me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:06] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Well, we&#8217;re still in the beginning stages, I&#8217;ll say that. So I&#8217;m still learning to simplify things. One of our biggest problems that we had with our templates, which I&#8217;ve talked to a couple founders today, who are going to help solve this problem, I&#8217;m grateful. But it was cumbersome for people to import our templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even though we have these different solutions, where you can import our form templates, email templates and automations, you had to do it all one by one. But we&#8217;re going to create a plugin, or a solution, where it&#8217;s a one click, you just click the button and you get to import everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m saying this to say that, our reception, I can&#8217;t give a direct answer with that just yet, because I haven&#8217;t had enough time being able to get feedback. The feedback that I have gotten has been really well. But I&#8217;ve also gotten feedback that let me know, hey, you&#8217;ve got some room to grow. And so we made changes based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is there any element of this which is a community project? Because obviously you&#8217;ve built a company around it, or you&#8217;ve adapted, you know, it&#8217;s a part of your other companies. But do you welcome contributions or ideas? Do you have a form out there, where people can give you suggestions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Heck yeah. I&#8217;m getting ready to work with another designer, a designer from BlackPress, shout out to Wyn. Anybody else who wants to contribute, involve, collaborate. I know I would appreciate it, I know my designer Dessa would appreciate it. Some help, you know, from others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the reason why I say that is because, to be, again, transparent, she&#8217;s from the Philippines. So to have a person who&#8217;s from a different country create imagery, or create designs for another culture, for people who are not them, it could be a little difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> So I want to bring some authenticity into it. For instance, I want to bring people from their own countries, and their own cultures, to help tell me, hey Maestro, you need to do this with that. That&#8217;s not what my people like. You may be reading the blogs, and reading things, and watching videos, but that&#8217;s not what we look like. That&#8217;s not what we do. So I need people like that, so that way we can be authentic when we&#8217;re representing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Where would you signpost people to go in the WordPress community? If things that you&#8217;ve mentioned so far have turned a light on with them, and they think, oh, this is something I could get involved in. I think I&#8217;ve got a voice that would help Maestro out. This is something that I&#8217;m aligned with. What kind of places would you go? Maybe that could be, I don&#8217;t, Slack channels, or it could be something different. It could be an individual who you&#8217;ve been impressed by, who you thought, okay, they&#8217;re really perfectly aligned. Tell us where to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:26] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> BlackPress is one of the communities that I&#8217;m heavily involved in, and I respect, because the founders are aligned with a lot of my views. There are other communities as well, that I&#8217;m discovering that could be as much of an intricate part in our mission, in our journey. However, I don&#8217;t know enough now to say, you know, all those communities are, at this point in time. And the communities that I thought were that, I found out they&#8217;re not that. Right now I&#8217;m in a little bit of a transition of, who are my communities and tribes that I can pull from and find?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But we can certainly, when we round off this podcast, we can reference you. And people can come and find you and, you know, maybe it&#8217;s a year from now, and you&#8217;ll have had a more solid idea of where you would want people to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds to me like you&#8217;re at the beginning of this journey then. You&#8217;re still trying to crystallise everything. You&#8217;re still thinking about the roadmap, you&#8217;re still figuring it out, and all of that. Where would we go if we wanted to find you? What&#8217;s the website? I think I mentioned it, but tell us again. What social channels, email address, whatever you want to share, where can we find you, Maestro?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:27] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Well, at this moment in time, you can just go to the website, and go to our contact page. If you really care, and you want to be involved, we have a nice form there. You know, I strive to make it as welcoming as possible for people. Or you can contact me on LinkedIn. So it&#8217;s either iconictemplates.com, you can find me on LinkedIn, Maestro Stevens, is a one of one. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anybody else in the world with that name. So you can either Google me, you can LinkedIn, you can go to the website Iconic Templates, or you can send a bird, you know? We can go old school, send a pigeon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is there anything we missed? Do you want to say something that we missed out on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> I think you hit a lot of things on the nail. I just want to say that it is great to be here to see you in person. I don&#8217;t know how long it was. Maybe, it feels like a year where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think about a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:11] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Yeah, Yeah we had our first interview online. So now, a year later, we&#8217;re meeting in person. It just shows how you just never know, and showing up is half the battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I love events like this. I get to meet fabulous people much like yourself. So, Maestro, thank you very much for chatting to me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:29] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Thank you, Nathan. I really appreciate you. You&#8217;re doing a great job with your podcast, with your platform. You are consistent. You are a working horse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I just wish had a better microphone at this event. But you can teach me all about that when we switch this one off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:43] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> I&#8217;m going to give you some tips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Take care, Maestro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:45] <strong>Maestro Stevens:</strong> Alright. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maestrostevens/\">Maestro Stevens</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro is an international speaker and managing director of The Iconic Expressions. His areas of expertise include digital marketing, brand strategy, web development, and project leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode Maestro lays out the case for how inclusivity is not just something that we need to be concerned about at things like events, but also in our WordPress website designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro recently gave a presentation at WordCamp Asia entitled, Unlocking Universal Creativity: The Future of Inclusive WordPress Design. He wants to get people to think about making design choices with inclusivity in mind, so that they are representative of various cultures and varied backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro reveals the challenges and the pushback he has faced on his journey, telling us about the struggles and support he’s found within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His approach includes utilising AI to create unique imagery, reflective of a diverse population, and how he sees this as something new in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion also gets into the practical side as well, with Maestro outlining some of the technical aspects and future plans for his ideas, extending an open invitation to listeners who wish to contribute or learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the intersection of creativity, representation, and the WordPress ecosystem, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://iconictemplates.com/\">Iconic Templates</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://iconictemplates.com/products/uni-blocks/\">Uni-Blocks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/kadence-blocks/\">Kadence Blocks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://elementor.com/\">Elementor</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpspectra.com/\">Spectra</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/home\">Midjourney</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2024/04/09/unlocking-universal-creativity-the-future-of-inclusive-wordpress-design/\">Unlocking Universal Creativity: The Future of Inclusive WordPress Design</a> &#8211;

Software development was a mystery to me, and JavaScript seemed like an alien language. But fate has a funny way of guiding us to unexpected places, and my journey into the world of technology began with a single WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had never been to a WordCamp, or any other tech-related gathering for that matter. But my husband was very active in the WordPress community in Riverside, California, and he had made a lot of good friends through Meetups and WordCamps. He had volunteered as one of the organizers for WordCamp Riverside one year and came back raving about what a great time he had, so the second year he volunteered, I decided to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6726_59c270-91 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Meeting The Family For The First Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I stepped into the event—held in an unassuming warehouse of a local solar panel company—the vibrant atmosphere greeted me like an old friend. Everywhere I looked, there were smiling faces, eager to share their knowledge and passion for WordPress. It was a community unlike any I had ever seen before. And while I didn&#8217;t have the technical skills, I was determined to soak up as much as I could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the day, I attended workshops and talks, my notebook quickly filling up with scribbled notes and newfound terms like CSS, plugins, and PHP. I even mustered up the courage to ask questions during the Q&amp;A sessions, feeling a sense of empowerment with each answer I received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it wasn&#8217;t just the knowledge that drew me in; it was the people. I made connections with designers, developers, and entrepreneurs alike, each one offering their support and guidance. They welcomed me into their community with open arms, assuring me that technical skills could be learned, and that my passion and enthusiasm were just as valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6726_099cf3-dc wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Reaching Out</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Encouraged by this supportive environment, I sought out people who were like me, but had already made it in the tech world. People who could guide me. So I search for black woman entrepreneurs working in tech, and I found a group in Los Angeles. It was there that I truly found my tribe—a diverse group of individuals who shared a common goal: to make the web a better place. We met regularly, offering free help to each other, discussing ideas, and collaborating on projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Months turned into years, and my understanding of WordPress and web development grew with each passing day. I took online courses, attended more WordCamps, and devoured every book on the subject I could find. What started as a curiosity had become an all-encompassing passion, a flame that burned brighter with each webpage I built.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6726_b86db4-a1 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Building A Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, I was able to take on some of the work in what would later become my company, <a href=\"http://brainjar.net/\">Brain Jar</a>. At that time, it was my husband’s long-running side hustle. He had a small handful of clients, and he served them on the train on his way to and from his day job as a web developer for a local college. My work started simple; optimizing photos, changing text, fixing errors. As my skills grew sharp and my confidence grew, I started taking on bigger projects until finally I was doing as much work as my husband was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I was working in what was fast becoming a family business, we were able to start taking on more clients instead of referring them out and hiring part-time employees. So our clientele and development team started growing bit by bit. As we grew, we noticed we were naturally slipping into different roles in the business. I started managing the budgets, payroll, meeting with clients, doing our usability studies, web traffic analytics, and other research-related tasks. My husband started managing our employees, managing projects, assisting our developers. So we decided I’d assume the role of CEO, and my husband became the CTO.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6726_fd5a0b-2f wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Moving Forward</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I’m just as busy as ever with Brain Jar, plus we run an online coding bootcamp called <a href=\"http://wpcodecamp.org/\">WP Code Camp</a>, hoping that we can help others get into the web development world that has been so good to us. But despite the hustle and chaos that comes with running two businesses, during an occasional quiet moment, I think back to that first WordCamp and the community that nurtured me. I owe my success to that community, the people who believed in me, who shared their knowledge and supported me on this incredible journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, with a heart full of gratitude, I continue to pay it forward. I speak at conferences, mentor aspiring developers, and volunteer for WordPress and other tech events in my community, all with the hope of inspiring others to follow their dreams, just as I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this vast world of technology, I found my place—a place where passion, community, and a willingness to learn can shape the trajectory of a life. And as I reflect on my journey, I am grateful for every stumble, every triumph, and every WordCamp that brought me here.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-i-found-my-place/\">How I Found My Place</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 08:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Dr. Rhiannon Little-Surowski\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"Gutenberg Times: Exploring the latest version of the Create Block Theme plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=28344\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/exploring-the-latest-version-of-the-create-block-theme-plugin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4572:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\">Create Block Theme plugin</a> was created to streamline block theme development by adding to the power of the Site Editor with theme specific goodies and workflows. The plugin aims to be a modern quick start tool for the world of block themes, allowing you to create your own or build upon existing themes without touching code. At a high level, here are the kinds of things you can accomplish with the plugin added to your site:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clone a Theme: Replicate an existing theme with a few clicks.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add Style Variations: Enhance a theme with different style options.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rewrite Global Styles Customizations: Modify Global Styles without touching the code.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create Child or Blank theme: Generate child themes or start with a blank slate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the latest version of Create Block Theme</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new version of the Create Block theme was released recently bringing some long awaited features that offer more advanced, streamlined, and open workflows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Theme.json inspector, allowing you to view your theme.json directly while building out a theme visually with the option to switch back and forth as you’d like.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using the Site Editor itself to handle all theme building related actions (clone, add style variation, etc) removing the need to context switch and creating a more intuitive building experience.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Playground Preview available in the Plugin directory making it as simple as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme\">selecting “Live Preview” on the directory listing to get started</a> with this powerful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ease your way into what’s new</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re new to block themes and haven’t yet used the plugin, this is an excellent place to start since you can quickly clone an existing theme to explore how to make it your own rather, perhaps by creating a specific style variation to use. Keep in mind that the plugin is meant for theme creation only rather than for use on a production site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme\">Select “Live Preview” on the plugin directory listing to get started</a> and start exploring. For example, you can follow the video below to create a custom style variation:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p><strong>Get access to early, theme specific features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Font Library, launched in WordPress 6.5, has its roots in the Create Block Theme plugin. While not every feature baked into the plugin is destined to make it into Core, it is a place where common problems facing theme authors are solved, and necessary workflows are built. Occasionally, this means early access to features that make it into Core or theme-specific enhancements. For example, in the plugin you can create and save a style variation <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45371\">long before this feature has come to Core.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same is true of the recently released theme.json inspector mentioned at the beginning of this post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Help shape the future</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Create Block Theme plugin is a community run plugin and has a more narrowed focus to block theme authors, it’s the perfect place to discuss common pain points and improve what’s there. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/287\">pattern management has repeatedly come up</a> as an area needing iteration and better tooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is now being explored in the Create Block Theme plugin to make it even easier to create your next block theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more in depth guides, we’ve got you covered with an <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/12/05/a-walk-through-tutorial-on-using-create-block-theme-plugin/\">in-depth walkthrough on the Developer blog</a> and a <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/streamline-your-block-theme-development-with-create-block-theme/\">Learn WordPress tutorial</a>.

It doesn’t build on what devs learned, nor does it use any existing directives API out there. This means that not only do developers have to learn a completely new API, but when they do, it doesn’t directly translate to anything else. Not only that, but you’re limited to whatever the API supports —&nbsp;it’s nowhere near as powerful or flexible as a raw React component. If you want to do more with it then the API itself will have to mature.&#8221; he wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/\">Need a plugin .zip from Gutenberg&#8217;s master branch?</a></strong><br />Gutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now also available via <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/playnightly.json\">WordPress Playground</a>.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the challenges and rewards of contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox. And use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Jonathan Desrosiers. Jonathan has been a contributor to WordPress core for many years, and a WordPress core committer since 2018. He currently maintains over a dozen core components. As a leader in the community, he advocates for new contributors through mentorship and active leadership. Jonathan currently works as a senior software engineer at Bluehost, where he is sponsored full-time to contribute to WordPress core through the five for the future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the challenges that come with contributing to such a large and multifaceted project. From the intricate process of decision-making, involving many stakeholders, to the occasional moments of feeling demoralized when contributions seemed like a dropping the ocean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the importance of regular contributions, the challenges of implementing an accreditation system for contributors, and the role of privilege in the ability to contribute and showcase your work publicly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amongst the technical talk, including the future of collaborative editing, and the need for adaptability, we also get into the human side of WordPress. From the ways in which individuals can get involved without coding, such as teaching, video processing, event organizing, and documentation, to the personal satisfaction Jonathan finds in his work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we chat about the sustainability of the open source ecosystem, emphasizing the critical role businesses need to play, and the potential risks when key contributors step back. But, as you&#8217;ll hear, Jonathan is confident about the future of WordPress, mentioning exciting development features on the horizon, like the new admin interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how you can contribute, what that looks like, and where it can take you, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note, before we begin. This was recorded live at WordCamp Asia. There was quite a lot of background noise to contend with, and I&#8217;ve done my best to make the audio as easy to listen to as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you, Jonathan Desrosiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Jonathan Desrosiers. Hi, Jonathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:39] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Hi. How are you Nathan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, really, really good. We are at WordCamp Asia. Jonathan, you gave a talk this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:45] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I did. This afternoon right after lunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. How did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> It went really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What was it about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:50] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> So I do a lot of the work around, we call it invisible work, around administration and things around the project, to make sure things continue to go smoothly and get released, and all of those things. And one of those things that I work on a lot is attribution for our contributors, and our community members. And mostly focused on the versions of WordPress and release to release, making sure the right people are listed on the credits page, and get the credit that they deserve. And so this was about why it&#8217;s extremely difficult. There&#8217;s lots of variables to consider when, you know, trying to be accurate in those representations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. And it was well received. You&#8217;re happy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:25] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> It was, yes. Very well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. We&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about contributing to the WordPress project. And that, I know, is something that you&#8217;ve got a long history doing. Do you want to just tell us a little bit about your history with WordPress, and all the different bits and pieces? I know there&#8217;s too much to say, but we&#8217;ll paraphrase. What have you been doing with WordPress since you started using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:43] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I discovered WordPress in probably like 2007 or 8. And I was in college building little sites for family members and friends. And that turned into, when I graduated I, you know, started building websites for small agencies, and moved into university education, and built websites for them through WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in 2018 I was hired by Bluehost as part of their Five for the Future initiative, to give back 5% of our resources, which is, if you are unfamiliar, encourage you to read about that. It&#8217;s a challenge from Matt Mullenweg to contribute 5% of your resources, to ensure we don&#8217;t have a tragedy of the commons situation, where we take too much from the project, and we don&#8217;t replenish what we use to make sure it&#8217;s better for the next people that come after us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Week to week I work, I&#8217;m a core committer as well, so committing changes to the code base. Making sure things are tested and we&#8217;re not missing something that could be problematic in the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And you are full-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:37] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I am, yes. I&#8217;m a full-time sponsored contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How unusual is that in your, I mean, obviously for you it&#8217;s your day-to-day, this is quite normal. But, how unusual is it to have somebody able to donate 100% of their time, working hours, over to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:52] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> It&#8217;s fairly unusual, that it&#8217;s not unicorns, but it&#8217;s very sporadic. You know, it&#8217;s not uncommon for someone to be sponsored 80% or 50%, you know, work on applying some initiatives to both WordPress, and internally to products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not unheard of, but it&#8217;s definitely hard to come by, and I&#8217;m definitely very fortunate to have had the stars align when I saw the job posting go up for this, so yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So Bluehost, I&#8217;m guessing from what you&#8217;ve just said, they are committed to Five for the Future, and the intention there is to give 5% of, I&#8217;m just going to use the word resources, lets call it that. 5% of the resources available, and you are a part of that. You fall under that 5%, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:33] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And that&#8217;s, you know, through our global sponsorship, our presence at events to help the community, volunteering at events, contributing to core and the project itself, and many other things that we get involved with over the days and weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m guessing that most of the contributions to WordPress, are not done from the perspective of somebody who is paid to do it. I&#8217;m imagining the vast majority of contributions across the whole project, you know. So we could be talking about events, we could be talking about the code base. There&#8217;s all sorts of things that we could be talking about. But I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s done largely by volunteers, because that&#8217;s the nature of open source software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that sustainable? Do you think that people&#8217;s value in the year 2024, do you think that people are valuing open source, contributing software, in the way that they did maybe at the dawn of the internet, you know, 25 odd years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:23] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I think that people do value it, they just don&#8217;t know it, in some cases. And we definitely need people to be more aware of how our businesses are powered and that the burden of maintaining these tools and libraries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Five for the Future program is, 5% is the goal, but it&#8217;s definitely, we should be doing more, and we could. Especially businesses that WordPress is where they play, where they set up in their ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, is it sustainable? You know, we will always need some extra help, and I think that we&#8217;ll never refuse extra help anywhere we can get it. It&#8217;s going to ebb and flow as well, right? We might need more at certain times. And in the community, we&#8217;ve needed more help recently, when trying to revitalise our events after Covid, and all of that nonsense that we had to deal with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it ebbs and flows, and the areas change where we need more attention than others. And I hope that people do value it as much as they say, and at least show it through their actions and giving back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just talk about the code base for a bit. WordPress is changing all the time. Month by month, we&#8217;ve got new releases. We&#8217;re currently 6.5, thereabouts. And it&#8217;s constantly being updated. So that tells me that the work is being done. There are people that are doing that, and you are obviously part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there enough people? Is it sustainable from that point of view? Do we have aspirations that the software would be better than it is, and we&#8217;re always stifled by the amount of time that people can put into it, and resources and what have you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah I mean, if we had more people, we could always go through more issues, and more features, right? But it&#8217;s definitely a delicate balance because, if we had a release with 500 features, our users won&#8217;t be able to keep up. And so we have to strike that balance. And, you know, we challenge that sometimes, where we put more into some releases than others. Maybe one release will be more bug focused, and polish refinement we&#8217;ll call it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we need more? Yes. We could always use more. We&#8217;ll never say no. But it&#8217;s always a balance with our users. We can&#8217;t release too quickly, not often enough. We&#8217;ve found that balance is pretty good at three releases a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps ensure that we have enough contributors to get what needs to get done, release to release. The features can, so-called, bake enough to be ready. We&#8217;ll have a good number of major features, and minor features available in that timeframe. That&#8217;s the balance that we&#8217;ve found works well for us right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is it usually the same people that are doing this work? So for example, if we were to go back, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say a year, or project a year into the future. Obviously you are going to be part of that makeup. Does it tend to be the same faces showing up? And I wonder if that could be kind of an Achilles heel in a way. You know, because if one of those people decided to move away from the project, they had other things that they wanted to do in their life, all of a sudden, if those familiar faces disappear, we might have a bit of a weakness. Gaps start to appear in the roster of who&#8217;s going to do what. So is that a problem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:11] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I think that that&#8217;s always been a problem, right? We never want to see our all stars move on to other things, but it&#8217;s life and that happens. And I think if you go back all the way to the project, there&#8217;s people that built major parts of WordPress, that are still in it today, that have moved on. And largely we&#8217;ve survived and grown and continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s probably a good percentage of people that are consistent, but there&#8217;s also a good percentage of people that are new, and willing to try new things, and help take on more responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s interesting. So there is always fresh blood, if you like, coming in. And you&#8217;ve noticed that, have you? It&#8217;s not like, you know, in one given year it sort of dries up, because I had an intuition that may be around the pandemic, it maybe lost a little bit of its luster, and the involvement in the community sort of ebbed a little bit. But it&#8217;s coming back, is it? And there&#8217;s always a pipeline of new people coming in, is there? That&#8217;s nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:03] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah. I think that there definitely was a good amount of computer burnout that happened. You know, we were all FaceTiming with our relatives and stuff, and work as well, and our coworkers. Friends at work, we were also zooming with. But things like the contributor mentorship program that&#8217;s being done, where we will take applications for people that need to know, just guidance, how to get started contributing, and how to be effective and efficient at contributing, in areas that we need them to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They sign up, and we have mentors. People like me that will match up with them. And over the course of a month or so, we&#8217;ll onboard them, help them with learning on Learn WP, different things. And help them actually get involved, and get their feet wet contributing, so that hopefully we can start to replenish some of that, up and coming new blood as you say, to replace anybody that may need to move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it really does feel like the project is taking that onboarding process, and the learning process, much more seriously, well, just in the last 12 months. So the idea of the mentor program, where somebody like you can guide somebody and give, presumably it would be adjacent to core committing or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You would take somebody who&#8217;s new to the project, and you&#8217;d show them the ropes, if you like. Explain where to find things, explain how the process is done. That&#8217;s a fabulous initiative. And also, like you say, lots of energy and time being put into the Learn materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m guessing that somebody somewhere, at some point over the last two years or so, identified this as a problem. You know, we to encourage these people. But if they don&#8217;t feel supported when they come in, it&#8217;s pretty likely that, you know, you&#8217;ll lose people who would&#8217;ve stuck around. So that&#8217;s been great I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:41] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> As full-time people, we recognise that it&#8217;s, whether it&#8217;s when we take time off and we come back, or we change focus for a week or two, and then come back to something. WordPress is quite large, and there&#8217;s a lot of moving parts, and there&#8217;s a significant velocity there. And so it&#8217;s kind of like jumping into a moving train, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so at times I have a hard time keeping up on certain areas of the project, and I rely on updates and summaries from various teams to catch me up. You know, it&#8217;s always important to keep that in mind when you&#8217;re working with people that have two hours a week, four hours a week, an hour a month that they contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We think about how can we download that information for what we know, from being so involved in an easier way, to make it more accessible to people that have less time, but still want to help and participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So this question isn&#8217;t necessarily related to the topic at hand, but I&#8217;m kind of interested what your thoughts are on this. We have over the last, well, really since WordPress began, the user base. The number of installs has just gone up, and up, and up. And we have this percentage figure now which we&#8217;ve reached, which is roughly 43% of all the web. Let&#8217;s call it that. I know that there&#8217;s nuance there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 43% of the web is powered by WordPress. I mean, that&#8217;s just an astronomical figure. And I don&#8217;t think 10 years ago anybody would&#8217;ve guessed that that would be what would be achieved. But that&#8217;s where we are. Does it matter to you that that number, either, let&#8217;s say it flattens out and it never goes beyond 43, or if it goes down and we&#8217;re back into the high thirties, or if it goes up and we&#8217;re into the fifties. Does any of that matter to you? Are you in this project because it&#8217;s popular, or do you just enjoy being part of it, regardless of all those incredible numbers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:21] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah I think, you know, obviously from a professional standpoint, I want it to grow and do good, because the company that I work for is a very firm stance in WordPress. We provide WordPress hosting, and that&#8217;s kind of our bread and butter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that, personally, I do it because I enjoy it. I like problem solving these really difficult problems at scale, and it&#8217;s always very fascinating to have to tackle these. I think that, to me the number itself doesn&#8217;t matter, but the number is a signal to observe and learn from, right? So if we plateau, is it something going on around us? Like, is AI having this impact in some way? Where people are considering a blog, or a CMS website, less than they would&#8217;ve in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we saw a little bit of influx in covid, and everybody was rushing to make a website. And so, now is there a lull, because people made their websites already, and there&#8217;s less people that would&#8217;ve spread out over time, that did a gold rush right at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can tell us a lot about our society. It could tell us a lot about trends, business trends, economic trends. And we kind of just need to take that number in stride, and figure out why we&#8217;re plateauing, or why we&#8217;re growing, and understand that a little bit better, and help it influence our decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Given the work that you do, and the communities, the Slack channels that you are in, and the GitHub issues that you are tracking and all of that, do you have a sense that contributing is still a popular thing to do? Or in the years that you&#8217;ve been doing it, has it been a bit of a struggle? I mean, we were talking about onboarding people, and all that kind of stuff. What&#8217;s your sort of gut feeling?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the outside, I don&#8217;t commit in the same way that you do. I don&#8217;t really know. I see more and more articles coming up in the WordPress press, about whether the community is dissatisfied. There was something in Search Engine Journal just the other day, saying that, there was growing dissatisfaction amongst the WordPress users. I don&#8217;t really sense that, but I wonder if you did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:13] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I think there&#8217;s a level of that. I think that it&#8217;s hard to tell the whole story in one survey, right? And we kind of need to step back, and look at the answers objectively, and try to figure out why people are answering the way they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a contributing standpoint, it&#8217;s really hard sometimes to see that you&#8217;re having an impact in your contributing, right? It used to be with a much smaller code base, it was much easier to put something in that you could see, visually that it&#8217;s there. Oh, it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s doing what I trained it to do, and coded it to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in the project with many more moving parts, sometimes it&#8217;s not as obvious, or it takes longer to get something in, because there&#8217;s more things to test, that&#8217;s more intricate. We have a lot more different types of sites at scale. We have 43% of the web now, instead of 5 or 10. And we have NASA and the White House using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so these are all things as committers we have to think about is like, how could this one line change, how could this negatively impact someone, and what are the bad things that this could cause?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so sometimes, if you have an hour a week, or two hours a week, that can be really frustrating because your ticket might sit there for six months. And it&#8217;s not because we want to ignore it, it&#8217;s just that either, a, it&#8217;s not really fully aligned with our goals, and our project priorities at that time. Doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not important, it&#8217;s just we have a limited amount of resources, even the full-time people. And we have to have a percentage of our focus on these lighthouses that we&#8217;re heading towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I guess all that to say that there is some dissatisfaction, but there&#8217;s always the opposite side as well. I always tell people, when I look at a product reviews, oh, this only has 4 stars or 3 stars, right? But you always have to keep in the back of your head that people that have a negative experience are also more vocal, right? They&#8217;re more likely to go and provide feedback because they&#8217;re aggravated, they&#8217;re mad at what they experienced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, is that also a thing here? Where we&#8217;re not really getting all the positive stories, because the negative people are just a little bit more vocal? All stuff that I think about, but I think that there&#8217;s always frustrations. There&#8217;s always good stories in the community, but it&#8217;s just because we&#8217;re so complicated. And there&#8217;s so many moving parts that we shouldn&#8217;t ignore any of those stories, but we should take it with a grain of salt, and consider what it means, and what&#8217;s behind it as we evaluate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It would be nice to be able to say that every moment that you contributed to the project, whether that&#8217;s code or whatever, was fantastic, you know? It was really exciting. It was always great. You got fabulous feedback. Everything was executed perfectly. But I&#8217;m sure it must be, on some level, sometimes a demoralising process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you said, you put a ticket in and nobody looks at it seemingly for six months. Or you are just in the weeds with code, and you can&#8217;t figure out what you&#8217;ve got to do. Do you have those moments where it can be, and I know it&#8217;s your job so it&#8217;s slightly different, but do you have those moments where it can be quite a demoralising experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:58] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Sometimes. I mean, you know, it&#8217;s a job, but it&#8217;s still something that I pour in a lot of time and effort, and I do care a lot about the project. I think that you&#8217;re never going to make everybody happy too, and that&#8217;s something that we always know in the back of our mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week we had to make a decision about how to move forward with the fonts library feature. Where do we put our fonts? And so, on one side, we want to establish fonts and patterns as these first class objects and concepts in WordPress. But then a lot of hosting infrastructure doesn&#8217;t actually support putting it in the place that we wanted to put them right in the wp-content folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we kind of had to come up with a compromise there. Everybody&#8217;s not going to be happy, and we have to decide on what&#8217;s best for our users, the majority of people. And yeah, sometimes it stinks to see negative feedback, but we just have to know that we&#8217;re trying to do our best with the information we have, the data that we have available to make an objective decision, and move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What&#8217;s the hierarchy of the decision making process? You mentioned there about the font library and, you know, some people will have said one thing, other people will have said another. Who gets to suggest things, and who gets to make the final decision about whether this is a go or a no go? I think it&#8217;d be kind of interesting for the listeners to have some insight into what&#8217;s going on in the background, to make the decisions that push the project on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:11] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I mean, anybody can make a suggestion. Anybody can open a pull request with an idea or a feature. The committers or the maintainers are always the people that will look at all the information and make the final call. And ultimately they&#8217;re responsible for the things that they merge, is essentially what it comes down to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there&#8217;s reasonable disagreement between them and it can&#8217;t get resolved, whomever the release leads are for, every release has a core tech lead and core editor lead. And so usually they will be a decider for the best way forward in those areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then when there&#8217;s a stalemate like this, it goes up to either the release lead, or Josepha will come and talk to some people that are on each side and, you know, the leaders in the areas, and determine what&#8217;s the best compromise, and what&#8217;s the best way to go forward with our users&#8217; best interests in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And where do you spend your time doing this work? I mean obviously, in your case there&#8217;s a laptop involved, I&#8217;m sure, or some machine. Are you doing all of this via Slack? How&#8217;s all of that communication going on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:09] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, a lot of my time spent in Slack, but also a lot of time is in Trac or GitHub. You know, working in public is so important, and so, as much as possible you should be in shared channels, or in GitHub tickets and issues, pull requests. Because, like you said, like people come and go, and that&#8217;s just a part of life and business and work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s important that we leave that history for others that come after us, to be able to follow along. Because in 10 years, this font library decision, people will be saying like, well, why do we do this this way, right? And it&#8217;s important that it&#8217;s publicly documented, because then we have like a breadcrumb trail that people can learn from, and get into our minds today to know what we were thinking and why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, nice. Your contribution is code. You write code, and you help with code, and GitHub, and all of that, and Trac. But there&#8217;s more to the bigger project, the WordPress project in general. So do you just want to spell out for the listeners, the kind of things that you could do? Obviously, if you&#8217;re in to code, that&#8217;s fine. We know that you can do that. What are some of the other areas that people contribute?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah. You know, if you&#8217;re a teacher or a trainer, we have Learn WordPress, which is a site where we have educational resources, whether it&#8217;s course outlines for you to use at a meet up or an event, to teach people how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have wordpress.tv, so if you are good with audio, video, you can review and process WordCamp videos. So like all the WordCamp videos from here will be available to everyone in the world, eventually. You can run events in your local communities. You can contribute documentation, whether that&#8217;s user or developer documentation. Going to make.wordpress.org, there&#8217;s a full list of all the teams that you can contribute to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s lots, and lots, and lots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:47] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> We&#8217;re over 20 now I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I mean essentially, it genuinely, there&#8217;s literally a role for everybody. If you rock up I think you&#8217;d struggle to find an individual that couldn&#8217;t fit into one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:56] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Even if you like taking photos, can be on the photo and the photo directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s so many different paths that you can go through. What do you get out of it? I know the job, but do you get a sort of sense of satisfaction doing this? Is there some part of you which just thinks this is good for humanity? You know, I&#8217;m involved in an open source thing, gives you the warm, fuzzy feeling that you&#8217;re doing something beneficial to the world, providing free software. Yeah, what do you, Jonathan, get out of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:19] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> You know, I always like puzzles and challenges like that, and trying to figure out how to fix things. I&#8217;ve always repaired computers since I was young and all that. And so these are just more interesting problems to learn from and tackle, especially at the scale that we&#8217;re at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also think that, some of the smartest people in the industry, you know, WordPress is so big, they gravitate towards it because these are such interesting problems. And so the people I meet, the people I learn from, the people I interact with all the time, I step back sometimes, I&#8217;m like, oh, this is really cool. You know, I&#8217;m learning from some of the smartest people out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And throughout the community, in all the different areas, we have so many brilliant people that are great people, and they&#8217;re willing to teach you, and you can learn so much from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It sounds like pride might be a good word. There&#8217;s sort of sense of pride in it. You get some badges as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:06] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, and you know, sometimes I&#8217;ll go to a website and it&#8217;s, oh, it&#8217;s a WordPress website, you know. I help that person make a living, or I help that person have a business. You know, especially when it&#8217;s like mom and pop stuff, or my son&#8217;s school is a WordPress site. I&#8217;m like, oh, that&#8217;s really cool. You know, my work goes into them being able to have a website, and all those different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We know that, in your case, Bluehost is funding you. And so thank you to Bluehost for that, that&#8217;s fabulous. But, do you know of any other ways that you can explore? If you literally can&#8217;t commit the time, because you are entirely busy, are there ways that you could seek funding, ways that you could be remunerated, maybe sponsored by a company? Let&#8217;s just go into that a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:47] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Sure, yeah. You can sponsor yourself. So one good way of doing that is, maybe you have a plugin that you build for a client, and you think it could be useful to other people. It&#8217;s not directly contributing to the project itself, but you&#8217;re contributing to the ecosystem if you open source that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s pros and cons of that, right? Because then you&#8217;re responsible to maintain it, or at least have to be transparent about what level of maintaining you&#8217;ll do. But you never know who could find that useful. And I know when I was at Boston University, we had a navigation plugin that we used internally with our authentication system. And so we made it open source, and there were some other universities that used the same authentication system that chose to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you never really know what will be useful to other people. So sponsoring yourself in that sense is that you&#8217;re just giving something you work on, that you already have to work on, right? Because maybe it&#8217;s for a client. You can just open source that, and obviously check with the client first, you know, make sure they&#8217;re okay with that. But that&#8217;s a great way to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sites like WP World, where you can, in a community, you can put yourself in that community as well. And it will list all the things that you work on, and all the, you know, where you&#8217;re from, who&#8217;s local to you, and what communities are local to you. And you can indicate that you are looking for work, or looking for freelance or employment on those types of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think sponsorship might be one of the options on there as well. Or on your GitHub profile, you can also accept donations and sponsorship on your GitHub profile. It&#8217;s another good way, especially if you&#8217;re a developer, to receive donations to fuel some of your contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. There&#8217;s also the WPCC, the WP Community Collective. I think they&#8217;ve recently got these kind of little areas that you can go as a WordPress user. Somebody like me, and I can contribute some money to a particular thing. It might be accessibility, for example. And then the idea would be that somebody can make use of that pot of money, that&#8217;s been built up over time ,and somebody could then get sponsored, and use that money, and then give themself a wage whilst they&#8217;re working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of that, and we talked a moment ago about, maybe the same faces keep coming back. There&#8217;s this idea, and I can&#8217;t remember exactly how to phrase it, but the phrase goes something like this. You can contribute to WordPress, or the people that do contribute to WordPress, are the people who can afford to contribute to WordPress. And I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a bit of truth in that, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That if you are independently wealthy, then you can give up all of your time to the WordPress project. If you are in a position working for a company, and they second you to the project, that also works as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any intuitions on that? Do you feel that it is as democratic as it could be? Or do you feel like there is a little bit of, those that can afford, can contribute, so they get their voice heard, and the decisions are made by the people who are able to contribute, because they&#8217;ve got big, deep pockets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:31] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah. I talked about that a little bit in my talk today, where my talk was focused on how we measure contributions, and we track them, and factors to that. And one of the things I talk about is that you can&#8217;t measure impact, right? So someone that contributes a three line code change, it may seem unimportant from a Git log perspective or like a commit log.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe that&#8217;s their first contribution to open source. And then, from there they are able to get hired, because they have this new experience. And that might change their life, that might open doors that they didn&#8217;t previously have available to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, in that sense, it&#8217;s hard to say because we can&#8217;t measure that. And so, on the surface, it looks like they&#8217;re not really receiving anything, because they&#8217;re not contributing a lot, or very infrequently, right? But on the outside, from their perspective, they&#8217;re receiving a lot. Because the benefits to them are not necessarily directly related to the project, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re getting experience, learning how to maybe code PHP, or use an API, and then they go do a job interview and they can talk about that, and how that experience went, and what they learned. And they can show that they are easily teachable, and attractive to an employer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, that&#8217;s only one part of it, right? It appears that only the people with a lot of time benefit from it, but there&#8217;s other benefits to just having their code frequently merged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Would you like to see some sort of accreditation system? Well, I mean we have the badges on the WordPress profiles. But would it be nice to have some sort of an official accreditation system? Honestly, I don&#8217;t know how that would be managed. I don&#8217;t know how it would be made to be fair and equitable, so that what you actually put in was measured in some way, tracked in some way, and then was equated to, I don&#8217;t know, a badge or something that you could add officially to your CV, or what have you. Do you think anything like that would be useful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:22] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Probably. But it also depends on another thing I talked about in my talk is, how do people expect to be recognised right? So, currently we collect all the contributors for our release, and it goes on our about page, that you see when you update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some people might not really, that may not really do much for them, right? Because you have to be in WordPress to see it, and they don&#8217;t really care about that. Maybe they want it to be, their profile to be, more like a CV, like you said. And so it shows to an employer, like how consistent they contribute, or what they&#8217;ve contributed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good metric, isn&#8217;t it? You know, consistency, and the fact that you&#8217;ve showed up for month, after month, after month. There&#8217;s something in that, there&#8217;s something very valuable in that little bit of data, isn&#8217;t there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:03] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Sure. But likewise, somebody could show up once every three months, but they&#8217;re, maybe they work for Google, and they build things into the browser. And so they show up once every three months, but they&#8217;re helping advise how to implement this new API that improves performance, or something of that nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so regularity is not always a good measure. Volume is not always a good measure, because you could contribute 50 times, but it&#8217;s like 50, 1 word typo fixes, right? Or you could contribute once, and you&#8217;re contributing an entire API, or something that unlocks a feature for hundreds of themes, and makes the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s really difficult to get right. And I think accreditation, a lot of companies spend a lot of money and time on keeping up, because we&#8217;re in technology and web, and it changes so quickly. I worry that, we have to do it in a way that adapts as we adapt. And I wonder if the value of that is outweighed by the effort that it would take to kind of stay accurate over the months and years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Every time this conversation comes up, almost immediately clever people chime into the conversation and point out why some sort of accreditation system would be very hard to do effectively. And I&#8217;m often very persuaded, you know? Like you said, do you measure time? Do you measure the frequency? Do you measure the thing that they did?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:21] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And it&#8217;s really, exactly, it&#8217;s really, really difficult. I think from my perspective, it would be nice if there was something, but I don&#8217;t know what that something would be, other than the sort of badge system that we&#8217;ve got at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:32] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I think in most cases it just ends up like we&#8217;re open source, and so your public work just speaks for itself, right? The way you interact with other people that disagree with you on public discussions. The repositories that you have that are open for people to view. The plugins that you create. That&#8217;s the best way, in my opinion, to have an open track record of your skills and what you have to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. And I suppose, in a way, every job interview that you go for, you are just going to write down the best bits that done, and so I guess maybe the traditional way that we&#8217;ve done it is probably still useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:03] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> But that&#8217;s also a privilege too, being able to be public about your work. And I&#8217;m privileged with that, because I work on an open source project right? But if you work at a corporation, you know, you can&#8217;t always show all of your work, talk about it. But it&#8217;s not something you could open source, you know, and let someone dive in and see your work, and the history of your work. So there&#8217;s also that aspect as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Are you confident about the future for WordPress? I mean, obviously you&#8217;re working in the industry, you&#8217;re saturated by it, you&#8217;re completely immersed in it. Do you have an expectation that 10 years from now, WordPress will still be strong? We&#8217;ll have a community, it will still be being developed. Does it feel like it&#8217;s on rock solid ground? It does to me, but I don&#8217;t know what your thoughts are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:42] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I think there&#8217;s always going to be spots you step on, and you&#8217;re like, oh, should I put all my weight there, right? I&#8217;m very confident in WordPress. I think last year was one of the more exciting years in quite a while. And the reason was, when we&#8217;re in the process, it&#8217;s sometimes easy to feel like we&#8217;re not going anywhere, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m involved week to week, month to month. And so, even release to release, it feels like we&#8217;re not getting a lot done. And last year was so exciting, because we reached the end of a phase of Gutenberg. And it was the culmination of all these releases that came before it, to see site editing, right? It was the first release where we said, you can make a great website with this site editor now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took that beta tag off and now it&#8217;s ready to go. And so, you know, we see a lot with 2024. Some people are making such incredible websites using this base theme. They look nothing like what was shipped. And it&#8217;s just really great to see these blocks, these different APIs that get built. All combining to make this cohesive thing that is really quite powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m really excited to see what people do with it this year. The Interactivity API, block bindings. All these new things that are coming. It&#8217;s like I say in my talk is, we&#8217;re so creative as a community, there&#8217;s so many brilliant people, and we&#8217;re giving them the tools to run with. And I&#8217;m really looking forward to see what people build with WordPress over the next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There is so much coming down the pipe very, very soon, isn&#8217;t there? So, obviously, we&#8217;re into phase three, collaborative editing at some point, probably not particularly quickly. But like you said, the Interactivity API, block bindings, and maybe a completely new admin interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does feel like there is a lot of change about to happen. And so, if you ask me that same question, do you feel confident? It feels like there&#8217;s every reason to be confident at the moment, because there&#8217;s so much interesting stuff happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:37] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Sure. Kind of to circle back to one of the things we talked about earlier, about the sense of frustration out there. Change is hard, you know? If you&#8217;ve built a business around a specific thing, and maybe you have admin notices, right? That you sell a premium plugin through, or something like that. When we redo the admin, it may not be exactly the same experience, right? And so you kind of have to rethink it a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that that&#8217;s where some of, frustration with innovation in a way. And change is always very hard, and it&#8217;s harder for certain people than others, and in different ways. But you have to look at both sides, and see where we&#8217;re going, know where that end point is, where we would like to end up, and see how exciting that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, a privilege to have the time and the resources to invest in updating, and embracing new technology, and learning. And we just keep an open mind, and follow us along. And follow all the thought leaders, and the people that experiment with the new features, and demonstrate what&#8217;s possible. I think we&#8217;ll definitely end up in a better spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I think it&#8217;s really difficult for those North Star, how to describe it, the big ticket items. It&#8217;s very hard to communicate those to the user base of WordPress. I mean, here we are, we&#8217;re at a WordPress event, so it&#8217;s pretty clear that everybody here is a bit nerdy about WordPress. So we understand that, because we&#8217;re talking about it all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the sort of end user, who&#8217;s suddenly confronted with, I don&#8217;t know, when the block editor came. Suddenly, what is that? Where did that come from? Being able to explain all of that to the wider public, I think is going to be an interesting thing. And I have intuitions that that&#8217;s going to be taken very seriously, in the near future as well. That communicating what&#8217;s coming, what the idea is, what the North Star is, going to become a big part in feeding that to the WordPress media, if you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:14] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Talking too, we also have to listen. You know, it might not be the feedback we&#8217;re expecting, or want to hear, but we need to have open ears and listen to that, and process that appropriately as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Slightly going off on a bit of a tangent. What are your thoughts about collaborative editing? From a technical point of view, that feels like that&#8217;s a really difficult challenge, given that we have no idea what infrastructure any WordPress website could be on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be on the most powerful server that has ever existed. Alternatively, it might be on something very affordable and economical. What do you think? Does it seem like a project which is going to be easy to ship, or it&#8217;s going to be keeping us busy for two, three years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:51] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> It&#8217;s definitely not easy. You know, it&#8217;s very intricate, many moving parts, and it definitely is going to be a many months roadmap that we have to follow. I think that, like we mentioned before is that, we&#8217;re always improving, technology is always changing, and we&#8217;re trying to embrace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have our performance team that&#8217;s, year over year we&#8217;re seeing tens of percentage point increase in performance. And obviously that will plateau as well too, right? But we keep adding new stuff, so they&#8217;ll keep having new things to look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m confident that when we build software, we balance these things, right? We don&#8217;t want to be, we want to add these very powerful features, but we keep performance in mind. We don&#8217;t want it to be slow, that you don&#8217;t want to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so these are things that we&#8217;re just constantly evaluating, and keeping in mind. And in the end, we stick to our philosophies of building great software, that works out of the box, that&#8217;s performant, that handles very difficult technical topics, and concepts for the user, and makes the best decision for them, but while being flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that&#8217;s really great about WordPress is, you can change it to be something that doesn&#8217;t even look WordPress, you know? Don&#8217;t even recognise it, and it&#8217;s still at the core, it&#8217;s still that software that everybody&#8217;s using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It sounds to me like you&#8217;re very bullish. You&#8217;re very confident that WordPress has a bright future, and we could well be sitting here in the year 2034.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:05] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Like I said, it might not be the smoothest road, there&#8217;s going to be bumps along the way. We just have to work together and listen, and constantly evolve, and don&#8217;t be stuck in our ways and get to that end point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If people have listened to this and they&#8217;ve thought to themselves, you know what, I fancy contributing in some way, but they want to talk to you about it, where can people find you, Jonathan? What&#8217;s the easiest place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:23] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Sure. You can find me at desrosj, pretty much everywhere. WordPress Slack, Twitter, and all of those places. You know, if you want to get started contributing, I recommend just going to make.wordpress.org. I believe there&#8217;s a getting started contributing course on learn.wordpress.org. And worst case, just hop into Slack and say, hey, I&#8217;m new, I just would like a little push in the right direction. And there&#8217;s handbook pages that will link to you, and break down how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s definitely a way to contribute, no matter what your station in life is, yeah. But thank you Jonathan for chatting to us today, I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:55] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Of course. Thanks for having me Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://jonathandesrosiers.com/\">Jonathan Desrosiers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan has been a contributor to WordPress Core for many years, and a WordPress Core committer since 2018. He currently maintains over a dozen Core components. As a leader in the community, he advocates for new contributors through mentorship and active leadership. Jonathan currently works as a Senior Software Engineer at Bluehost, where he is sponsored full-time to contribute to WordPress Core through the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the challenges that come with contributing to such a large and multi-faceted project, from the intricate process of decision-making, involving many stakeholders, to the occasional moments of feeling demoralised when contributions seem like a drop in the ocean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the importance of regular contributions, the challenges of implementing an accreditation system for contributors, and the role of privilege in the ability to contribute and showcase your work publicly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amongst the technical talk, including the future of collaborative editing, and the need for adaptability, we also get into the human side of WordPress. From the ways in which individuals can get involved without coding, such as teaching, video processing, event organising, and documentation, to the personal satisfaction Jonathan finds in his work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end we chat about the sustainability of the open-source ecosystem, emphasising the critical role businesses need to play, and the potential risks when key contributors step back. But, as you’ll hear, Jonathan is confident about the future of WordPress, mentioning exciting development features on the horizon, like a new admin interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about how you can contribute, what that looks likes, and where it can take you, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\">Bluehost</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/learn/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/contributor-day/contributor-working-group/contributor-mentorship-program-for-wordpress/\">Contributor Mentorship Program for WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thewp.world/\">The WP World</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thewpcommunitycollective.com/\">WordPress Community Collective</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/desrosj\">Jonathan&#8217;s X / Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jonathandesrosiers.com/\">Jonathan&#8217;s website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Akismet: CAPTCHA vs reCAPTCHA vs Akismet: Which is Best?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=283860\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://akismet.com/blog/akismet-vs-captcha-vs-recaptcha/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27816:\"<p>Any website that gets a lot of traffic also has to deal with a lot of spam. Enterprise-level sites require powerful solutions to protect both customers and company resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you satisfied with your current solution? Do you really understand the alternatives? Choosing the right anti-spam software can significantly improve the effectiveness of everything done through your site. In other words —&nbsp;a happier marketing department, security team, <em>and </em>executives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, pay close attention to this in&#8209;depth comparison of CAPTCHA vs reCAPTCHA vs Akismet to gain a clear understanding of these tools. You need to consider how efficiently they can block spam, how they impact the user experience, and whether they’ll affect your site’s performance (among other considerations). Only then will you be in a strong position to choose the right solution for your company or finally dump that under&#8209;performing option you’ve been falling back on for&nbsp;years.</p>\n\n\n<p>This post will explain how CAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA, and Akismet work, outline their key differences and similarities, and provide a thorough comparison.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283860\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"understanding-akismet-captcha-and recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding Akismet, CAPTCHA, and&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n<p>If you’re tasked with selecting an effective anti-spam solution for your company, the stakes are high. When uncontrolled, spam can negatively impact your conversion funnel, damage your search engine rankings, put your visitors at risk, and skew your performance metrics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need a reliable tool that can get the job done. Of course, it should also be easy to manage, so you won’t have to spend a tremendous amount of time training your security team, and easy to use, so visitors don’t get frustrated trying to perform basic functions on your site.<br />What’s more, choosing the right solution is only half the battle. You’ll likely have to justify your choice to key decision makers. So you’ll need to thoroughly research different options and explain your decision based on those findings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>That’s where this comparison comes in. It will start by providing an overview of the most popular anti&#8209;spam solutions: Akismet, CAPTCHA, and&nbsp;reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: AI&#8209;driven spam&nbsp;protection</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is a tool that provides AI&#8209;driven spam protection. It uses machine learning to scan and filter submissions in real&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"856\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-8.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the tagline \" />\n\n\n<p>Akismet can protect your entire website. That includes blocking spam in comment sections and forums, while preventing fake user registrations and protecting contact&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet boasts 99.99% spam detection accuracy. That means it’s very unlikely it will block out legitimate&nbsp;submissions.</p>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Akismet is a “set it and forget it” style tool. It works on the back end, so after you configure it, you won’t have to worry about managing it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, it works without requiring any actions from your legitimate site visitors —&nbsp;no riddles to ponder, puzzles to solve, or boxes to check. The result is a much happier audience (and better conversion rates). We’ll discuss this more in a bit.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CAPTCHA: The classic anti&#8209;spam&nbsp;test</h3>\n\n<p>CAPTCHA stands for “completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart”. “Turing test” refers to the inventor Alan Turing, who created some of the first experiments to test a machine’s ability to show human&nbsp;intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>But a CAPTCHA is actually a reverse Turing test. You’ve likely come across plenty of CAPTCHA tests&nbsp;before.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1252\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-9.png\" alt=\"traditional reCAPTCHA with mixed up letters\" class=\"wp-image-283863\" />\n\n\n<p>As this is a reverse Turing test, its main purpose is to weed out malicious bots that try to spam your&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n\n<p>The mechanism used in CAPTCHA is called <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/HIPSCHI2005.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">human interaction proof (HIP)</a>. It requires individuals to prove they are humans via a challenge. The task should be relatively easy for any human to complete, but near impossible for a bot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Typically, visitors are presented with an image containing distorted letters and numbers, and they must decipher and input those characters in a field for approval. If they succeed, they can proceed with the action they’re attempting to complete (like submitting a&nbsp;form).</p>\n\n<p>There are many other forms of CAPTCHAs, though, like audio CAPTCHAs that present challenges using spoken&nbsp;characters.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, CAPTCHAs have been used to reduce form spam. They can be included as a final field in a submission form, or configured to pop up on the&nbsp;screen.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-an-evolution-of captcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA: An evolution of&nbsp;CAPTCHA</h3>\n\n<p>In recent years, reCAPTCHA has become more common than CAPTCHA. Bots quickly evolved to be able to solve traditional CAPTCHAs, so Google created the&nbsp;reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"954\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-10.png\" alt=\"evolution of reCAPTCHA\" class=\"wp-image-283864\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the main types of reCAPTCHAs used by websites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v1&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The original iteration, reCAPTCHA v1, showed combinations of characters. It pulled images from books (as part of a larger digitization project), or used an algorithm to generate them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also used a similar mechanism as a traditional CAPTCHA, but it provided site visitors with one control word and one ‘suspicious’ word. The suspicious word was selected via <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ocr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">optical character recognition (OCR) software</a>. This was part of a larger process to rate and identify words for the reverse Turing test.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v1 could also leverage images instead of distorted&nbsp;words.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1028\" height=\"1282\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-11.png\" alt=\"reCAPTCHA with the prompt to select all squares with sunflowers\" class=\"wp-image-283865\" />\n\n\n<p>As you probably already know, there are some serious user experience and accessibility issues with these types of reCAPTCHAs. In fact, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/versions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reCAPTCHA v1 was shut down</a> in&nbsp;2018.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v2&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After reCAPTCHA v1, Google developed a more streamlined version called reCAPTCHA v2 or “noCAPTCHA”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>There are a few subtypes of this particular reCAPTCHA version. But since most of them are invisible, many people are only familiar with the “I’m not a robot”&nbsp;checkbox.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1372\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-12.png\" alt=\"I\'m not a robot reCAPTCHA\" class=\"wp-image-283866\" />\n\n\n<p>As you can see, this requires less effort on the part of site visitors. The goal of reCAPTCHA v2 was to provide a seamless&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of a reverse Turing test, reCAPTCHA v2 analyzes user behavior on web pages. If a site visitor is deemed suspicious, they are presented with the checkbox prompt. Otherwise, they are passed through without being aware of the back&#8209;end&nbsp;test.</p>\n\n<p>Another subtype of reCAPTCHA v2 uses an invisible badge. It works in the same way, but hides the checkbox behind a preexisting button on your website. When this type of reCAPTCHA is enabled on a website, you’ll see the&nbsp;following:</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"976\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-13.png\" alt=\"notice that says \" />\n\n\n<p>This version of reCAPTCHA also works for Android devices. But it’s important to note that it requires some form of user interaction, like clicking on a button, for it to be&nbsp;effective.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v3&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n<p>As you can see, reCAPTCHAs have evolved to become increasingly discreet, which is certainly the case when it comes to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2018/10/introducing-recaptcha-v3-new-way-to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reCAPTCHA v3</a>. This version of Google’s anti&#8209;spam technology goes a step further and verifies requests in the larger context of your&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n<p>It looks at visitor behavior (as with reCAPTCHA v2), but it also considers visitor history. In technical terms, it’s a JavaScript API that gives each request a score. Then website owners can take action based on those&nbsp;scores.</p>\n\n<p>Google recommends that you use reCAPTCHA v3 to verify forms or “actions” (i.e. clicks). You can also run it in the background on individual pages to collect data on&nbsp;traffic.</p>\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the newest version of reCAPTCHA has some serious flaws. First of all, legitimate users may not always have recourse if they’re falsely identified as spam —&nbsp;and it doesn’t report nearly as accurate of results as Akismet’s 99.99%. So you could be costing your company a shot at legitimate leads and customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>And reCAPTCHA v3 also has some serious privacy issues as it essentially relies on surveillance of individual users&#8217; behavior beyond just their visit to your site. It’s caused a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90369697/googles-new-recaptcha-has-a-dark-side\">fair amount of controversy</a> that may bleed over to your&nbsp;organization.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA Enterprise</h4>\n\n\n<p>Google offers reCAPTCHA Enterprise for larger businesses. It’s very similar to reCAPTCHA v3 in that it is frictionless for site visitors, working mostly on the back&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n<p>The main difference is that reCAPTCHA Enterprise can be applied across an entire website, not just a simple form or web page. Additionally, it’s more precise and allows for more&nbsp;customization.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"captcha-vs-recaptcha-vs-akismet-key-differences-and similarities\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">CAPTCHA vs reCAPTCHA vs Akismet: Key differences and&nbsp;similarities</h2>\n\n\n<p>This section will look at Akismet vs reCAPTCHA vs CAPTCHA, focusing on their differences and similarities. Keep in mind that this is just a summary. You’ll find a more detailed comparative analysis in the next section.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"captcha-vs recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">CAPTCHA vs&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h3>\n\n<p>The main difference between CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA is that most versions of the latter are a lot more subtle than the&nbsp;former.</p>\n\n<p>The only reCAPTCHA that employed a similar challenge to CAPTCHA was v1, and that version is no longer in use. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/recaptcha-v2-vs-v3/\">reCAPTCHA v2 and v3</a>, as well as the Enterprise version don’t interfere as much with the user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p>In most cases, if a visitor is flagged as suspicious, they’ll be required to validate their legitimacy by simply checking a box or clicking on a button. And in the case of the invisible CAPTCHA, they may not have to perform any action at&nbsp;all.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"captcha-vs akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">CAPTCHA vs&nbsp;Akismet</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you put CAPTCHA and Akismet head to head, there’s no competition. They offer opposite types of anti-spam solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHA very overtly interrupts the user experience, requiring visitors who are filling out a web form to complete a test before they can proceed through the conversion funnel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Akismet works completely on the back end, using AI and machine learning to detect malicious spambots and stop them in their tracks. It won’t interfere with the experience of legitimate&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-vs akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA vs&nbsp;Akismet</h3>\n\n<p>It only really makes sense to compare reCAPTCHA Enterprise and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">Akismet</a>. This is because reCAPTCHA v1 and v2 can’t compete with Akismet as they interfere with the user experience, just like CAPTCHA. And all non&#8209;enterprise versions of reCAPTCHA (including v3) can only be implemented on forms or actions (like button&nbsp;clicks).</p>\n\n<p>Akismet offers complete solutions for both small businesses and enterprises. These tools won’t work on just one form or page, but on your entire website and everything it&nbsp;contains.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, the software is very user&#8209;friendly, both for your security team and your website visitors. Once you install and configure the tool, you won’t have to worry about anything else. It will work silently in the background, using AI and machine learning to identify and filter out multiple types of spam in real&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, most versions of reCAPTCHA just focus on forms and button interactions, whereas Akismet <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/forum-spam/\">blocks form spam</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/comment-spam/\">spam comments</a>, and any type of text&#8209;based&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<p>While reCAPTCHA Enterprise can offer a full&#8209;site solution, it still won’t give you the same level of sophistication and coverage as Akismet Enterprise. In fact, many <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">well&#8209;known enterprises like ConvertKit</a> use Akismet for their anti&#8209;spam&nbsp;needs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"captcha-vs-recaptcha-vs-akismet-comparative analysis\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">CAPTCHA vs reCAPTCHA vs Akismet: Comparative&nbsp;Analysis</h2>\n\n<p>Now, it’s time to delve into a more in&#8209;depth analysis of Akismet vs reCAPTCHA vs CAPTCHA. This section puts these anti&#8209;spam solutions head&#8209;to&#8209;head on factors like effectiveness, user experience, accessibility, and&nbsp;more.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-effectiveness-against-spam-and bots\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Effectiveness against spam and&nbsp;bots</h3>\n\n<p>When you’re choosing an anti&#8209;spam solution for a business of any size, effectiveness is obviously a key consideration. So, how do CAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA, and Akismet compare in this&nbsp;area?</p>\n\n<p>First, studies show that <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2023/08/17/captcha-tests-keep-more-humans-than-bots-out-study-shows/70609691007/\">bots are now more effective</a> than humans at passing CAPTCHA tests.<br />That means CAPTCHAs are essentially&nbsp;obsolete.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, due to poor user experience and accessibility issues, reCAPTCHAs can hurt your bottom line. They can end up alienating legitimate visitors. Furthermore, CAPTCHAs and most reCAPTCHAs can only be implemented on individual forms and web&nbsp;pages.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet is the most comprehensive option, and the most effective. It provides coverage for your entire website, not just a single web form or page. That includes protection against comment, form, and text spam. Plus, it doesn’t impact the user experience in any&nbsp;way.</p>\n\n\n<p>While you can implement reCAPTCHA Enterprise across an entire website, and it will protect against multiple types of spam, the code behind it has some downsides. It uses a JavaScript API, which can slow down your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Akismet uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify, filter, and block spam in real time. Akismet maintains a huge spam database (probably the biggest in the world), but all of this data is stored in the cloud so it doesn’t impact your site’s performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-user-experience-and accessibility\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. User experience and&nbsp;accessibility</h3>\n\n<p>If you run an online business, offering a top&#8209;notch experience is essential. Your site’s visitors should be able to navigate seamlessly through your website and its components, including forms and comment&nbsp;sections.</p>\n\n<p>When visitors encounter issues, they may become frustrated and abandon the page. Plus, a poor website experience can damage your company’s&nbsp;reputation.</p>\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA both fall short in terms of user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHA is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjD1gyFHULI\">well-known for being frustrating at times</a>, as some of the character-based and image challenges can be difficult to solve. Legitimate site visitors may fail the test and end up blocked from completing an important action, like filling out a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/lead-capture-form/\">lead capture form</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, CAPTCHAs and some reCAPTCHAs (v1 and v2) present a major accessibility problem, as individuals with vision impairments may have trouble completing the reverse Turing tests. Likewise, anyone with a hearing impairment may be unable to complete audio&nbsp;CAPTCHAs.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, reCAPTCHA v3 can alienate any individuals who are navigating the web in alternative ways. For instance, if a site visitor is using a voice tool or keyboard navigation, their keystrokes or interactions could be unfairly flagged as&nbsp;“suspicious”.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-impact-on-form-conversion rates\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Impact on form conversion&nbsp;rates</h3>\n\n<p>When visitors can navigate seamlessly through your site’s conversion funnel, your company will be better able to maximize profits. On the contrary, if an anti&#8209;spam tool is causing friction, the business might lose&nbsp;conversions.</p>\n\n<p>Most versions of reCAPTCHA can interfere with the steps in a sales funnel. For example, a site visitor may encounter a reCAPTCHA when creating a customer account, and another one when making a purchase. Both create opportunities for them to become frustrated and&nbsp;leave.</p>\n\n<p>Only reCAPTCHA v3 and reCAPTCHA Enterprise can provide a solution as discreet as Akismet. But as mentioned earlier, reCAPTCHA’s JavaScript API can impact your site’s&nbsp;performance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-impact-on-page speed\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Impact on page&nbsp;speed</h3>\n\n\n<p>Fast load times are an important aspect of a positive user experience. They also impact your <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/wordpress-core-web-vitals/\">Core Web Vitals scores</a>, and as a result, they may affect your search engine rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, you’ll want an anti-spam solution that minimally impacts your website’s loading times. Since reCAPTCHA uses JavaScript or a JavaScript API on the back end of your site, this will likely slow it down — especially if you’re using a lot of other scripts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google’s developers recommend that reCAPTCHA should be <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/loading\">loaded asynchronously</a>. But this can require some advanced configuration, or adding another optimization tool to your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>In contrast, Akismet is cloud&#8209;based, so it won’t have any negative impact on your page&nbsp;speed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-integration-and compatibility\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Integration and&nbsp;compatibility</h3>\n\n<p>You might not want to use reCAPTCHA on websites that are already using a lot of JavaScript (unless you’re optimizing for speed with another tool). Additionally, reCAPTCHA Enterprise works with Google Cloud, so you’ll need to make sure it supports the infrastructure of your&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet and Akismet Enterprise can be used on WordPress and many <a href=\"https://akismet.com/support/getting-started/does-akismet-only-work-with-wordpress/\">other platforms</a>, including Drupal, phpBB3, Joomla, and&nbsp;more.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of compatibility, Akismet offers a more streamlined, hands&#8209;off solution. This is likely ideal if you’re a busy security professional with lots of other important tasks on your&nbsp;schedule.</p>\n\n\n<p>If your business only has access to a small team, you might not have the personnel required for the services that reCAPTCHA Enterprise offers. Therefore, Akismet will be a better solution for you, as it doesn’t entail much work to run and maintain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"captcha-vs-recaptcha-vs-akismet-the-bottom line\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">CAPTCHA vs reCAPTCHA vs Akismet: The bottom&nbsp;line</h2>\n\n\n<p>Whether you run a small business or manage a team of security experts at an enterprise, you’ll need a robust anti-spam solution for your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As discussed in this article, there’s no reason to use CAPTCHAs anymore, as they are outdated and present serious issues in terms of user experience and accessibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, most reCAPTCHAs can disturb the customer journey, and unless you’re using reCAPTCHA Enterprise, you’ll need to implement them on individual forms and&nbsp;pages.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet, on the other hand, offers a complete solution for your enterprise website. What’s more, it’s cloud&#8209;based and uses sophisticated AI and machine learning to get the job&nbsp;done.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-started-with-akismet-in-three steps\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to get started with Akismet (in three&nbsp;steps)</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve decided to use Akismet, here’s how to set it up on a WordPress&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"step-1-install-and-activate-the-akismet plugin\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin</h3>\n\n\n<p>First, you’ll want to navigate to your WordPress dashboard and go to <strong>Plugins → Add New</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You should see Akismet as one of the featured options. But if not, you can use the search tool to find&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"612\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-14.png\" alt=\"Akismet plugin in the WordPress Plugins section\" class=\"wp-image-283869\" />\n\n\n<p>Then click <strong>Install Now</strong>, followed by&nbsp;<strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"step-2-set-up-your-akismet account\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Set up your Akismet&nbsp;account</h3>\n\n<p>After you activate the Akismet plugin, you’ll be directed to a setup page in your WordPress dashboard. Alternatively, you could click on <strong>Settings → Akismet&nbsp;Anti&#8209;spam</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"859\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-15.png\" alt=\"prompt to set up an Akismet account\" class=\"wp-image-283870\" />\n\n\n<p>To proceed, simply hit the <strong>Set up your Akismet account</strong> button. Then you’ll be led to a page that shows all the different Akismet pricing plans. You’ll need to choose a plan and sign up for an&nbsp;account.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"step-3-enter-your-api key\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Enter your API&nbsp;key</h3>\n\n<p>Once you’ve purchased an Akismet plan, you’ll be given an API key to connect your account to your WordPress website. Go ahead and enter this key into&nbsp;WordPress.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-16.png\" alt=\"field to enter an API key\" class=\"wp-image-283871\" />\n\n\n<p>Then, click on <strong>Connect with API key</strong>, and that’s it! Akismet doesn’t require any configuration, but <a href=\"https://akismet.com/support/getting-started/confirm/\">you can easily check to see if it’s&nbsp;working</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Ready to improve your site and eliminate spam?

To sum up the key points, here are some answers to frequently asked questions about these&nbsp;tools.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is captcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;CAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n<p>CAPTCHA stands for “completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart”. It’s a test or “challenge” that a site visitor must complete in order to fill out a web form. The most common types of CAPTCHAs require individuals to decipher distorted characters or select specific&nbsp;images.</p>\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs provide a poor user experience and can lead to accessibility issues. So you’ll likely want to look for a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">CAPTCHA&nbsp;alternative</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-different-types-of captchas\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the different types of&nbsp;CAPTCHAs?</h3>\n\n\n<p>There are a few different types of CAPTCHAs. In the past, the most common options were character-based or image-based. These required individuals to either decipher distorted letters and numbers, or select images that contain certain elements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>There were also audio CAPTCHAs, which required visitors to listen to a series of letters and numbers, then input them into the fields&nbsp;provided.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is an iteration of the original CAPTCHA test. It’s more user&#8209;friendly than basic CAPTCHA, and tends to be invisible. At most, it may require site visitors to check a box to confirm their&nbsp;legitimacy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is a comprehensive anti&#8209;spam software solution that you can install on the back end of your site. It uses AI and machine learning to block form spam, comment spam, and any other text&#8209;based&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"is-akismet-better-than-captcha-and recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Akismet better than CAPTCHA and&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is a better solution than CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA. It protects against a wide net of spam (not just form spam) and can be implemented on an entire site (not just an individual page). Akismet can do this thanks to AI and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Plus, it’s user&#8209;friendly, accessible, and discreet. It doesn’t interfere with the user experience the way that CAPTCHAs and some reCAPTCHAs do. And since it’s cloud&#8209;based, it won’t negatively impact your website’s&nbsp;performance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-accurate-is-akismet-at-stopping spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How accurate is Akismet at stopping&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet offers a 99.99% accuracy rate when stopping&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-many-sites-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How many sites use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>More than 100 million websites use Akismet, and the software has blocked more than 548,914,109,725 pieces of spam (at the time of this writing). Furthermore, plenty of well&#8209;known brands, like Microsoft and Bluehost, use&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more-about akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn more about&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>You can learn more about Akismet by checking out its <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">full list of features</a> on the official

WordPress powers <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management\">more than 40% of the web</a>. That’s a massive reach—one that comes with a similarly large responsibility. With so many people using the CMS, the WordPress community should always consider strategies for improving the visitor experience. This is where website performance plays a crucial role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How fast a web page loads, how quickly a page reacts when you click a button, or how smoothly it scrolls can all significantly impact the end-user experience. A more performant site can lead to <a href=\"https://web.dev/case-studies/vitals-business-impact\">higher reader engagement and more conversions</a>. Thankfully, over the past few years, the WordPress project has made major performance improvements across the board for the core platform, plugins, and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many enhancements are available out of the box, with no configuration required. They improve the website frontend&#8217;s performance—the part visitors see—and various parts of the administrative experience, such as the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a partial list of performance upgrades from the past year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 6.3 brought several <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/19/analyzing-the-core-web-vitals-performance-impact-of-wordpress-6-3-in-the-field/\">enhancements to image loading</a>. This resulted in an improvement of up to 21% in loading time for any WordPress page with a hero image.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress 6.5 launched with a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">more efficient translation engine</a>. In benchmark testing, it improved WordPress response time by 23% for all localized WordPress sites. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">More than 55% of all WordPress sites</a> worldwide use a language other than US English and would benefit from this enhancement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress 6.5 also included several performance optimizations for the Block Editor, leading to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">5x faster typing processing and 2x faster load times</a> when creating or editing content in the site and post editors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the Core enhancements listed above, the WordPress project continues to work on several efforts that indirectly benefit the ecosystem&#8217;s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, WordPress Core leverages <a href=\"https://codehealth.vercel.app/project/wordpress\">automated tooling for continuously monitoring its performance</a>, covering every product update. This helps measure new features&#8217; performance improvements and enables contributors to detect potential performance problems during the development of a new feature or release so any issues can be proactively addressed long before end users are affected. A project is currently underway to make the same tooling used by WordPress Core developers available to plugin and theme authors as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/\">WordPress plugin checker</a> allows checking any plugin for performance best practices, among other requirements and recommendations. The plugin checker should lead to more performance awareness in plugin authors and, eventually, faster plugins. If you develop plugins, consider integrating this tool into your development and testing workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, WordPress 6.5 introduced the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/04/interactivity-api-dev-note/\">Interactivity API</a>, which is a technical foundation that facilitates more performant user interactions. This new infrastructure drastically simplifies the implementation of interactive website features and can even centrally control certain aspects of performance, keeping multiple independent plugins operating efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These performance updates result from a collaborative effort from all corners of the community, including the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/about-the-team/\">WordPress Performance Team</a>. This team, founded in 2021, underscores the WordPress project’s commitment to performance. And the results are substantial: Compared to a year ago, 8% more WordPress sites <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/12/19/wordpress-performance-impact-on-core-web-vitals-in-2023/\">deliver good load time performance at scale</a>—significantly better than the overall web’s 5.5% load time improvement. The web is getting more performant, and WordPress is leading the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress contributors are determined to continue this trend by working on further performance iterations. Whether you’re a WordPress end user, administrator, site builder, or developer, you can contribute to this effort. Anyone can test the performance features before being released in Core through individual feature plugins. Each feature can be tested via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab plugin</a>, so please try them!

Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Today, I want to talk about the Data Liberation project that we first introduced at State of the Word. It&#8217;s a very big project with a lot of philosophical underpinning. So today, I have with me Jordan Gillman, who&#8217;s going to help us dig in a little bit deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jordan, welcome to the show. It&#8217;s so great to have you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:57] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Thank you. It&#8217;s lovely to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Before we get started, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself? Like what parts of the WordPress project you contribute to, and how long you&#8217;ve been hanging around in open source?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:09] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, beautiful. I would love to. My name is Jordan. I live on the east coast of Australia, about an hour out of Sydney—about 10 minutes from the beach, which is a pretty great place to live. My relationship with WordPress began 19 or 18 years ago, I guess. I was tinkering with Movable Type, and they changed their license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I went, I need to find something that&#8217;s free. And at that point, I had no idea what open source was. I just knew that I could use this WordPress platform for free to you know, tinker around and build websites. At the time, I was a graphic designer and, so web stuff was just fun. But gradually, that kind of took over, and I ended up doing a lot of front-end development and eventually freelancing for about ten years, building WordPress sites for churches and schools and kind of non-profit organizations like that. And through that, I&#8217;ve also then ended up doing some support for WordPress and landed being lucky enough now to be sponsored to contribute full-time into the WordPress project. I do a lot of work with the support team, so working in the public forums, particularly on core WordPress plugins and themes like Gutenberg and bundled themes, Twenty Twenty-Four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:15] <strong>Jordan:</strong> But also working with the team itself, trying to make sure the forums are a nice place for people to hang out and answer questions and get their questions answered. And I also help out with a few other things around the place. I have an eye on the work the plugins team&#8217;s doing, working with the WordPress Foundation on a few different things. I&#8217;m lucky to have my fingers in a few pies but the biggest pie at the moment I have is the Data Liberation project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:36] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So let&#8217;s talk about that. We&#8217;re going to give everyone a quick like starting line. If, for some reason, you have not read or seen anything about the WordPress project plans so far in the last four months, you may not know what the Data Liberation project is, and that&#8217;s fine, too. Because Jordan and I are here to help you understand what it is. But, the Data Liberation project is something that Matt introduced to the project at State of the Word last year in December. And you, Jordan, are the one who are really helping us to take this project into a space where we have everything that we need, all the kind of tools and guides that users will need in order to do what exactly? Like, let&#8217;s go through what this Data Liberation project is from your standpoint and what made you excited to work on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:27] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Thank you. Yeah, so the general idea of the Data Liberation project is it should be super duper easy for anyone to bring their site to WordPress. That&#8217;s the first main part of it, is that regardless of the platform you are on currently, be it something that&#8217;s pretty open, be it something that&#8217;s really kind of walls and closed, be it a social media platform, another web building platform, it should be really easy to bring your content over to a WordPress site, because once it&#8217;s in a WordPress site, it&#8217;s essentially free. You can then take it and do what you want with it once it&#8217;s in WordPress, but we want to make it as easy as possible to get it here, basically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Free as in liberated, not free as in like, now the stuff that was in your mind has no value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, free as in liberated, free as in you own it and can do what you want with it. So that&#8217;s a big part of it. It&#8217;s, let&#8217;s get, make it easier for people to come to WordPress. I think it&#8217;s also important that if we&#8217;re talking about Data Liberation and freedom of content and democratizing publishing, that also means we make it easier for people to take their content from WordPress and use it somewhere else if that&#8217;s the decision that they make. And there&#8217;s some moves we can make to make that easier and nicer for people as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So, recently, we just finished up an outreach period where we were making sure that we were talking to, like, folks in the community and anyone, anyone who uses WordPress that wanted to talk to us about what they needed, what they were hoping for, what issues, what pain points they&#8217;ve had when they were looking at site migrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what, to the best of your knowledge at the moment, like what are the big themes that you got out of that feedback loop? Out of that outreach?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:08] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, thank you. That was really enjoyable, actually. I was lucky enough to, I got to speak to a bunch of people in person at WordCamp Asia, which was great. We&#8217;d done some, some online, did a hallway hangout, and we&#8217;ve had a survey out for a while to folks predominantly kind of in the hosting agency freelancer space. So, folks who are working with end users who are often the ones doing migrations. We got a lot of feedback about WordPress to WordPress migration and the challenges of different hosting platforms and access from users and a bunch of information, which is useful and interesting but not immediately relevant to the comparison to migrating to WordPress from another platform entirely.<br /><br />But at the same time, talking to particularly agencies who do a lot of big-scale migrations, there&#8217;s a lot of challenges just when it comes to, for starters, getting the content out of the platform. Some platforms are kind of helpful, and they&#8217;ll even provide a WordPress formatted export. For every one of those, there are&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:03] <strong><strong>Josepha:</strong> </strong>That&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:05] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, those are super helpful. For every one of those there are probably two or three who aren&#8217;t as helpful, and you start to resort to tricks with, you know, manually exporting databases or getting RSS feeds and trying to convert them, or a lot of agencies said, &#8220;You know what? Often, we end up just copying and pasting page by page from the source site into a brand-new WordPress site.&#8221;<br /><br />[00:06:27] <strong>Jordan:</strong> So, there&#8217;s challenges about the access to the content. There&#8217;s lots of challenges around getting the content from the shape of one platform into WordPress. What constitutes a page? What constitutes a post? How do we handle all of the extra metadata of images and dates and taxonomies, and anything else that might be associated with a blob of content in one platform?<br /><br />How do we translate that into the way WordPress likes to handle those things? And particularly taking that to another level, even just bringing it into the Block Editor? It was great to hear how many people are just migrating straight to the Block Editor like they want the content in blocks, which is wonderful to hear.<br /><br />[00:07:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yay!<br /><br />[00:07:05] <strong>Jordan:</strong> But there are challenges. I know it&#8217;s great. But there are some, there are challenges with that and getting it to kind of format the way they expect, when it comes in particularly because there&#8217;s some kind of functional challenges with that in validating the way the content comes in because it all happens client side in the browser. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to do that in big batches. So, there was some really great feedback around all of those kinds of places. It was really interesting to see how much of it centers around that getting the content and then getting the content, and yeah, for the agencies I spoke to, they do a lot of trial and error of, you know, custom scripts, and let&#8217;s try it. Oh, that did this. Let&#8217;s try again with a few tweaks. So I&#8217;m excited to see how we can kind of make that easier for them and, you know, maybe get it happening first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It has been a long time since I migrated any sites personally, but I remember the first time that I tried to migrate a site. So, I was on Xanga before Xanga was on WordPress, and I remember that when I was like, I can&#8217;t figure out this WordPress thing, but I think I need some stuff in it so that, like, I know what it&#8217;s going to look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know what to move around cause I didn&#8217;t know the names for anything in, in CSS or HTML. Like I didn&#8217;t know what to look for in the code, but if I had a piece of content in it, I could be like, find the content in the code and then move that. And so I was like, I&#8217;m going to export everything because there was an export option in Xanga. And move it into WordPress, and WordPress was like if you can manage to get it out of Xanga, super easy to get it in. But it was actually really difficult to figure out how to get it out. And fortunately, I&#8217;d only been writing on it for like four years, three, four years at that point. So there wasn&#8217;t like, a huge amount of content, but also, I was a pretty prolific writer. I was a bad writer, but the only way to get better at things you&#8217;re bad at is to do it a lot. So, I did a lot of bad writing for three or four years. And I think that in the end, I did, like, just pay some service to scrape everything that was public on it, and then go through and get the private things and pull it out later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think later on down the road, I did an actual like full migration when it was easier to get it done and got all the content out, including like drafts and private posts and things. So that&#8217;s good. But yeah, it was really difficult then. And then, like, we have the blocks now that are supposed to help get a little bit more consistency in the way that you can move content in and out of a WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is that something that we are then focusing on with the Data Liberation project? Is that something that&#8217;s being done in concert with our Gutenberg plugin, or like how are we accounting for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:46] <strong>Jordan:</strong> That is a great question. The way things are looking at the moment, having come out of this feedback and the way we&#8217;re looking at going forward that, that work on getting content coming into blocks is going to be a really, really major part of Data Liberation. And it kind of sits in the middle of things to my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:01] <strong>Jordan:</strong> The improvements that we can make with handling the way content is transformed into blocks gives us the potential of wins in a lot of places. So, as long as we can get to the content, this work on HTML to blocks for a better, lack of a better way of putting it, gives us wins with importing from another platform because we can take the content in whatever form it is, turn it into blocks in the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gives us wins with migrating from classic editor because, similarly, we can take the HTML of the classic editor generates and turn it into blocks. That already kind of happens, but there&#8217;s definitely some work that we can do to keep improving that. It gives us potential wins around the spaces of moving from between proprietary builders and block libraries and things. Because if we start to have a better-standardized set of ways to handle HTML into blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you can essentially move from whatever form your content is in into, you know, core native blocks in the editor. So, I think work there is going to be really important because it gives us a foundation to aim for from whatever the migration is happening from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] <strong>Jordan:</strong> So, there&#8217;ll be some work there. There&#8217;s already work happening on the HTML API. Like, ongoingly and regularly and so we&#8217;ll be talking to those folks. There&#8217;s obviously going to be a lot of overlap with the work within Gutenberg as well, which is doing you know, parsing of content into blocks. So, it&#8217;s going to take a lot of collaboration and a lot of work from everyone, but I&#8217;m really excited because if we can get that foundational platform of transforming HTML into blocks really, really smooth, then what we can do is we can, you know, activate contributors in the community say, we&#8217;ve got this part figured out. If you can get it to here, it&#8217;s going to come in beautifully. So what we want your help with is to say, how do I get out of this platform to a format that we can do the rest? So, hopefully, we&#8217;re getting a common flow for a big part of that important migration process. And then we can throw it open to others to say, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got expertise with this platform. That&#8217;s excellent. Can you get us to here? And we&#8217;ll take it from there.&#8221; And maybe we&#8217;ll get some wins by doing that work in parallel, and we&#8217;ll really start to see some movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And speaking of the, we&#8217;ll take it from there. I know that also, in addition to the work that you are doing with Data Liberation and that is happening on the Gutenberg side and WordPress core in general, we also have a little bit of work happening on the after you get it to here point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the folks over at Playground have been doing a bit of research about how to use the guides and tools that are in the Data Liberation repo. To run all of that through Playground so that you can not only like import it, but you can put it into Playground and check it before you launch it in someplace else, which I think is a great user-facing, like, super important thing for an everyday user to be able to have at their fingertips that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also the tour plugin that was built, I think specifically for the Polyglots team, is where we are looking at using, and I can&#8217;t remember which little project we&#8217;re doing some research on to make this possible, but we&#8217;re looking at taking that tour plugin and making it so that anyone can build a tour on anyone&#8217;s version of something in a browser so that you can just say, okay, so I did these things. I got it to here as you requested. I&#8217;m moving it to here. But now that I have got it into WordPress, what are the literal buttons I have to press in order to make sure it&#8217;s live? What do I literally have to press in order to make sure that I&#8217;m in the right time zone? Like, things like that. And we tested it on Wix, and it was able to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Not that we&#8217;re trying to get anyone to Wix. But on the subject of, like, getting things out of WordPress and into someone else, that sounds counterintuitive for folks, like, you&#8217;re here listening to a WordPress podcast, and we&#8217;re talking about how and why we want to make it easier for people to get their content to us, of course, but then also, if needed, get it out of a version of WordPress and either into a different version of WordPress with a new host or, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if this is not your long-term destination, which we think it will be once you figure us out, but like, if it&#8217;s not, like, how to get out of it, too. So, from your perspective, how does that fit with the basic philosophies of open source or of WordPress in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:24] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, thank you. If I may, there&#8217;s a couple of things I wanted to touch on from what you&#8217;ve said. First of all the other work that is going on in the project at the moment that you mentioned, the tour guide and the Playground, I think both of those are going to be super important to the approach we take to Data Liberation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to elaborate just a little bit on the Playground because I&#8217;m particularly excited about the potential that gives for two particular scenarios two particular use cases for migration. One is, where I&#8217;ve already set up a WordPress site, I&#8217;ve got the theme that I&#8217;d like, and I&#8217;ve got some, you know, some plugins, maybe I&#8217;ve got a little bit there, but I want to import content, but I want to check how it is the potential for the Playground to make essentially a staging copy of my site and migrate the content into that staging copy so I can see how it lands in my chosen theme and check everything out and then go, yep, that looks great. And apply it. That&#8217;s great for it&#8217;s safe. You can check how it looks before it&#8217;s, you know, committed. So that&#8217;s brilliant. I&#8217;m excited about that. I&#8217;m also excited about the potential it has for people who don&#8217;t know WordPress, or don&#8217;t have a WordPress site, or they don&#8217;t have a host, they don&#8217;t have anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Jordan:</strong> But if they can say, I want to see how this would go in WordPress. Playground, through some platform, somewhere, will allow them to just have an immediate in-browser preview of what their site would look like on WordPress. And if they like it, we then move them. We help them find a host. We help them export that in a way that they can use, but it helps the people who already have sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think, more importantly, it helps those who don&#8217;t have a site yet. And they don&#8217;t have to set up an empty WordPress install in order to start migrating. They can just get into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And also, you don&#8217;t have to, like know who your host needs to be before you can take a look at the back end of a WordPress site and see if it makes sense to you. Like I think that that is a huge, huge win on behalf of users, current users, and future users of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the try before you buy. Come kick our tires without having to find a server. If you all don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, if you have not heard of Playground yet, you can go to playground.WordPress.net and give it a try. It&#8217;s a one-click, serverless local version of WordPress that you can test out themes on and plugins, and just like put all your data into all your content into, and pretty soon also be able to export or just load directly onto the host of your choice. It&#8217;s really, really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:44] <strong>Jordan:</strong> It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s pretty much magic, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:47] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes, I remember the first hackathon where we took it because we took it basically on a hackathon roadshow for six months. I remember the first one we took it to. Routinely, we could get developers, not me, routinely, Adam Zieliński could get a developer to do the thing, and they&#8217;d be like, I can do it if you&#8217;re next to me telling me what to do, but it&#8217;s literal magic. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening. And he was like, okay, I&#8217;ll come explain it to you. And like, he was using English, but also I was like, that is still magic. I&#8217;m so glad someone understands it. It&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:18] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, so the Playground I&#8217;m super excited by. I think it&#8217;s going to be really important. The tour stuff the tour functionality is going to be really important as well. Because on some level, We&#8217;re going to have to wrap all of this work on improving HTML to blocks, the process of taking an export file and importing it into WordPress, the process of telling people how to get the content, all that&#8217;s going to have to be ideally wrapped up in a nice user-friendly way so that users aren&#8217;t having to, you know, read plain text articles and then going and installing a plugin and all of those kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the potential for the tours is we may have some kind of wrapper plugin or something which will detect the platform of your existing site if you put the URL in, and it will start walking you through the steps. So, part of that might be action you need to take on your existing platform, and we have some of that information already in the guides on the Data Liberation site at WordPress.org/data-liberation. That information is already there, but I&#8217;m hoping that we can start pulling those guides into the WP Admin so you just get walked through it while you&#8217;re there. And we can start using the tour functionality to really specifically pinpoint: you need to go here, now you can do this, go and click this, and just walk users through that migration process a little bit more neatly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:37] <strong>Jordan:</strong> I&#8217;m really excited that we&#8217;re going to be able to utilize a lot of these existing projects that are exciting and happening at the moment. And I think, ideally, they&#8217;re all going to make it much easier for users to not have to jump through so many hoops. And the hoops that they do have to jump through, we can hold their hand while they do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Create safe scaffolding for fun, I used to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] <strong>Jordan:</strong> So those are the two projects existing that are happening at the moment that I&#8217;m excited about rolling into and working with for the Data Liberation work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:07] <strong>Jordan:</strong> You also asked about the getting content back out, which is something that I&#8217;m particularly passionate about, I suppose. Which may be ironic when a lot of the aim of this project is to get people into WordPress. But I&#8217;m a really firm believer that if our mission is to democratize publishing, then that doesn&#8217;t mean just get everyone onto WordPress and go, yes, now you&#8217;re trapped. It&#8217;s like the Hotel California, you can never leave. If we&#8217;re going to be, you know, fully all in on democratizing publishing, then that means giving folks the freedom to take their content to do with it, whatever they want. It&#8217;s fair to say at the moment that that is possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can export your content from WordPress. We don&#8217;t hang onto it. We don&#8217;t lock it down. You can take it. At the moment, the format that you get that content in has some limitations. It&#8217;s fair to say it doesn&#8217;t handle bringing the media of your site particularly well unless you&#8217;re turning it into another WordPress site somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the export functionality is very, very focused at the moment on migration to another host, or to a local site, or to another WordPress installation, basically. But if you want to use that content for something else, maybe another platform. Maybe you just want to have a copy of your blog posts that you can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Print it into a book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Yeah, to put into a book. Maybe you want to put it on a thumb drive and put it in a lockbox somewhere. Maybe you want some kind of hundred-year archive of your intellectual property that you&#8217;ve written and created. And so I think we&#8217;ve got some room to make improvements there. Not only to the way we provide content for other platforms to pick up and bring in but also just in the ways that we provide content to users who just really want to have a physical, digital copy of what they&#8217;ve created.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some challenges at the moment when you get an export, if you&#8217;ve got shortcodes in your content, if you&#8217;ve got content that&#8217;s generated by plugins, all kinds of dynamic content that is great when it&#8217;s a website, and WordPress is wonderful. And there&#8217;s all of these options, but if you take an export, you have references to those functions, and you have references to those shortcodes, which aren&#8217;t actually fully realized. So I think there&#8217;s some room for us to investigate what does a better export for other platforms look like and what does a better export for &#8220;I want to print it out or turn it into a book or just have a static version of that&#8221; content look like. And so I&#8217;m particularly excited about that, even though it&#8217;s kind of, bring it in, and we want to let them get it out. But that&#8217;s part of the whole liberation of data, I suppose, is, you know, the freedom to do with it what you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And everything that increases freedom on the open web, I think we are in favor of. So, I don&#8217;t know if you follow many, like WordPress futurists, our people who are out there saying, if only WordPress had these additional 2,500 hours worth of work, then we could do this with it. Like, I don&#8217;t know if you follow a lot of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But, a lot of them look at that thing that Matt said, like, I want to say, five years ago about WordPress becoming the operating system of the web and putting some thought into what would be required to make that possible. And when we look at composable CMSs, like the option to have something that is a framework and a core of what you are doing in your digital experience of the web. And making it possible to add anything to it required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that also the work that we&#8217;re doing with Data Liberation to provide a little bit more consistency and just standardization of the way that content comes in and out, I think, can only help with that potential future implementation of WordPress as the operating system for the web so that you have this basic place where you hold and manage all your content and also not only does WordPress cooperate nicely with all these other tools and applications that you can put on top of it but also all of the content has standard conversational touch points and so everything moves quickly in and out including the dynamic content that is maybe being created inside your WordPress core itself. I think that is also a really important not primary focus, but certainly future-like, if only we could get to that state kind of focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:31] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m really interested. I think that the Data Liberation project is big, and I know that we expected primarily only new contributors to work on it, but honestly, we know that&#8217;s not the case. It&#8217;s you&#8217;re working on old WordPress in here and so not necessarily new contributors. But I think that you&#8217;re right that the place for new contributors to help us is saying like we can get the content to here, we can get the data to here, and then we need help getting it into WordPress or help getting it into something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as like a last question here, or if you have things to add to that, and then I can do last question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:04] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Okay, so to loop back to your conversation about futurists and moving content and stuff, I am really excited about this idea that the open web at the moment, I think, is really, really exciting. I just started mucking around with federating my content in the fediverse. Again, recently, I tried it a little while ago and really struggled, but I&#8217;ve just started again, and it&#8217;s sitting really comfortably with me, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s feeling like it&#8217;s a great time for posting and owning your content, and then syndicating it elsewhere. I have seen a couple of really interesting conversations about what you were saying about, like I&#8217;ve seen the conversations in the past about, you know, operating system of the web, but also some talk and ideas recently about what would it look like if we stored all of our data in a WordPress instance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if all of my photos aren&#8217;t on Instagram? They are on my WordPress site. What if I pull in my Fitbit or my Strava information and just store it in WordPress so that I can do with it what I want once it&#8217;s there? What if I, I don&#8217;t know, what if I pull in kind of all of my different sources of data and I, and I house them in WordPress and then I can do with them what they want, would do with them what I want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:08] <strong>Jordan:</strong> And that is when the Data Liberation stuff becomes especially important because if it&#8217;s your everything, you want to take your everything somewhere else. But I&#8217;m really excited for kind of all of that kind of space at the moment and giving people the freedom to own that data and when they create stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In actual fact, this is one of the things that you said in your talk at WordCamp Asia, which has really stuck with me was, and I can&#8217;t remember the exact phrase, but you said if you&#8217;re going to do all of this work of creating something, you may as well do it somewhere where you own it and can keep it. And that, for me, is just such a strong driver for getting people onto WordPress. Particularly from, at the moment, social media platforms. I&#8217;ve got two young daughters who are just getting to the age where they&#8217;re creating videos at home, which aren&#8217;t being published anywhere, but they&#8217;re starting to. They&#8217;ve got friends who are doing YouTube channels, and they&#8217;ve got friends on Instagram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m looking at all of that going, I get the urge to create, and I get the urge to publish, but I want them to have an alternative to do all of that so that in five years&#8217; time, ten years time, whatever it is, when they go, wow, I did all of this stuff. I don&#8217;t want that owned by someone else. I&#8217;ve created all this, and I&#8217;m excited by the possibility of having that become a simpler, more user-friendly, accessible option to folks, where it becomes just as easy to have a WordPress site, which is your Instagram feed or a WordPress site, which is your YouTube channel or something like that, where you own it, and you just create it, and it exists. And Data Liberation means you want to take a copy of all that stuff, go for it, download an archive, you know, print out the photos, do whatever you want, but they&#8217;re yours. You have them. And so, it&#8217;s really feeling like all of that is coalescing together a little bit at the moment. I think it&#8217;s a really exciting time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And also, like, since we&#8217;re just meandering around in philosophical spaces, two philosophical thoughts. One, I really, really feel like it&#8217;s important and valuable for people to document their lives. I have a pretty private social media presence; mostly, if you&#8217;re following me on social media, it&#8217;s because, like, you have literally been in my living room or you&#8217;re looking for WordPress news. Like that&#8217;s it. But I am constantly am documenting my life just for myself, like the folks who are listening, which is everybody, because we don&#8217;t do video, will not know that I have back behind me a shelf that is nothing but journals from my leadership journey, like from the moment that I realized that like leadership was something that was a skill and could change people&#8217;s lives like I&#8217;ve done nothing but document like I ran into this problem. This is the research that I did to figure out what was happening and not, and just like it&#8217;s really mundane things in my work now. But the work and the process of documenting, like, what&#8217;s happening for you and with you in your life and how you&#8217;re interacting with it, like, it&#8217;s just important for your mental health and for your understanding of the passage of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But then also you were talking about, like, having a hundred-year archive of your thoughts and things, like, there will be a point at which digital information being ephemeral because it&#8217;s just electricity wandering around between screens, like, it&#8217;s prone to getting lost in the same way that physical things are prone to getting lost, but the loss is less acute in the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you can accidentally lose it. And I think that that&#8217;s a real long-term not problem for society necessarily, but I think it is something from a societal standpoint where we&#8217;re gonna, at some point in the near future, realize that some of us have huge missing gaps where we, like just got rid of everything that we ever documented because we had a moment on social media or because it seemed like the only way to reclaim our content or our data or our privacy or whatever it was. And so I have a yeah. I love it. I love everything that we&#8217;re talking about, about the speculative future and WordPress. And so yes, now, well, now everybody knows all my thoughts on speculative WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:06] <strong>Jordan:</strong> There&#8217;s an interesting philosophical conversation which we&#8217;re like coming towards of what&#8217;s the equivalent in a hundred years, in 200 years of now, of the Library of Congress for philosophical and powerful writing. There is so much great stuff that is written on the web, and it just exists there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a hundred years, when people are writing about the early work of an artist or a politician or, you know, a notable figure, we don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re not going to have handwritten letters. We&#8217;re not going to have correspondence. But we&#8217;ll have tweets. We could have blog posts. Like, it interests me to think, like, the stuff that we take for granted of historical creation is happening digitally now. And so, equivalently, in the future, how, how is that gonna get retained? How much amazing knowledge and thinking is gonna just, you know, have their hosting account expire and get removed? And it&#8217;s an, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a big conversation, but it&#8217;s an interesting one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Oh, what a fascinating discussion we&#8217;ve had today. So, by way of wrapping up our discussion here, why don&#8217;t you give us a sense for, like, if you are a user of WordPress and you were like, this sounds really interesting, I want to learn more, where can they go? But also, if you are someone who wants to learn how to contribute to WordPress and this sounds like a good opportunity for you to get started with that. Where can people find more about this project, about how to get started, how to contribute, all that stuff?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:38] <strong>Jordan:</strong> If you are someone who is hearing about this for the first time and coming to it pretty fresh and haven&#8217;t been working in the WordPress community much before. The best place to go will be WordPress.org/data-liberation, that will give you not only access to the tools and guides that exist but also some information on where the development and discussion is happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the easiest pathway to find your way into those conversations as well. For folks who already have a little bit of experience and, it may be contributed code or a part of discussions already. The place to go to would be github.com/WordPress/data-liberation. That&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a lot of discussion. That&#8217;s where the existing tools and guides are being managed and worked on. So, if you really want to dive in. Please come and join us there. There are discussions to be had. There are ideas to be floated. That&#8217;s where all of the boots-on-the-ground work is going to be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:25] <strong>Jordan:</strong> The other great place is within the Make WordPress Slack organization. And we have a Data Liberation channel in there. That is primarily where we have higher-level conversations, and we chat about stuff, and I&#8217;m hoping that becomes a real hub for work-adjacent discussion. So GitHub is going to be for all of this is where all the work&#8217;s happening, but the Slack channel is where people can share their thoughts on what&#8217;s possible, and big picture ideas, and that kind of stuff. So those will be the three best places. WordPress.org/data-liberation for the overview, github.com/WordPress/data-liberation for where the work&#8217;s actually happening, and WordPress Slack in the Data Liberation channel. If you want to come and chat more about the possibilities and, you know, helping get the future of the open web happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I mean, that is an enticing call to action. We&#8217;ll have links to all of the, all three of those in the show notes, as well as links to everything that we kind of mentioned over the course of our conversation. But Jordan, thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:32] <strong>Jordan:</strong> Thank you so much for having me. It&#8217;s been great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:34] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got three things for you this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing on the list is that WordCamp US tickets are now on sale. So that event is happening from September 17th through the 20th in Portland, Oregon. There are general admission tickets and micro sponsor tickets available. And if you have seen the cost of the ticket but had not quite noted the length of the event, I just want to assure you that the cost per day is the same now as it was and has been for years. It&#8217;s still that same 25-dollar-a-day ticket that you&#8217;ve got; it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s four days long this time. We&#8217;ll have a link to the tickets in the show notes, but then also you can always wander over to us.wordcamp.org, and it&#8217;ll take you right there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our list is that WordPress 6.5 is here. It is named Regina. If you listened to our show last week, you know that it was a huge release and kind of has something for everyone. So, if you have not yet downloaded it to take a look at it, do that. If you have not updated your sites yet, run a backup because you should always do a backup and then get that on your site and start testing everything out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our big list, our small list of big things, is actually that we&#8217;re looking at dropping support for PHP 7. 0 and 7. 1 in upcoming releases of WordPress this year. It should not be too disruptive a change. However, it is going to take a lot of people to test it and make sure that everything&#8217;s working as we want it to work and as we need it to work. And so while we head toward that, I want to make sure you&#8217;ve got the resources that you need to know what&#8217;s happening, where it&#8217;s happening, how it&#8217;s going to affect you. I&#8217;ll leave some resources in the show notes for that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser, or if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org.

Gravatar&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-21.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1342\" /><em>Gravatar homepage</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram is just one platform, and if you want to create a permanent space on the internet, you need to think about your online presence beyond social media.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to do that is by creating a universal profile – an online identity that travels with you no matter where you go. <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> by <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> is a free tool that can do that and much more. While not exclusively a “link in bio” tool, Gravatar still brings a lot of useful features that you can use to expand your Instagram bio section.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is what you can do with it!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Personalize your “About” section</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to describe yourself in a captivating way with just 150 characters, but that’s all Instagram gives you. With Gravatar, however, you have the opportunity to craft an “About” section brimming with personality. When users click on the Gravatar link, they’ll be redirected to your Gravatar profile which will look more or less like this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-22.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1343\" /><em>Gravatar profile bio section</em>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a space where you can tell <em>your story</em>, sharing not just a basic bio but also details, such as your name, pronunciation, and location.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>List your verified accounts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking and showing your verified accounts is important as it gives you more brand credibility, whether you&#8217;re an influencer, CEO, author, academic speaker, and so on. As a result, people who open your Gravatar profile will be more inclined to follow you on different platforms beyond Instagram, and they&#8217;ll know where to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Gravatar, you can add multiple popular platforms, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/x\">X/Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a>, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-23.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1344\" /><em>Gravatar’s verified accounts list</em>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add important links</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Confined by Instagram&#8217;s solo link policy? Gravatar can help! Accentuate your profile with curated links pointing to your latest blog posts, eCommerce stores, or other important profiles and pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-24.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1345\" /><em>Gravatar links feature</em>\n\n\n\n<p>The way you display your links matters! To increase their visibility, put your most important links at the top of your profile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Share payment links and cryptocurrency wallet addresses</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides normal links, with Gravatar you can also create a versatile and personalized wallet, adding payment links and cryptocurrency wallets. This allows you to add another way of monetizing your online presence, as well as gather money for charity and important causes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"446\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-25.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1346\" /><em>Adding payment links to your Gravatar profile</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect with websites like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paypal.android.p2pmobile&hl=en_US\">PayPal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\">Patreon</a>, <a href=\"https://venmo.com/\">Venmo</a>, <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://litecoin.org/\">Litecoin</a>, and <a href=\"https://dogecoin.com/\">Dogecoin</a> in seconds! And the best part is that adding wallets will not clutter your “About” section. Instead, a new button will appear called “Pay” that people will be able to click and choose the best payment option.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"339\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-26.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1347\" /><em>The</em> <em>“Pay” button in Gravatar’s “About” section</em>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add your contact information</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With Gravatar, you can centralize your contact information and save users from the hunt and peck of tracking down your email or phone number.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-27.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1348\" /><em>Gravatar contact information</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Include only what you’re comfortable sharing publicly, striking a balance between transparency and privacy.&nbsp;Similar to the payment options section, instead of putting everything in the same profile area, a new “Contact” button appears, containing all your contact information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add photos</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Curate a selection of images that enhance your profile’s narrative. For photographers, this is a great place to put some of your work. If you’re a thought-leadership expert, put some pictures from conferences or lectures that you’ve done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-28.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1349\" /><em>Gravatar uploading photos to the profile</em>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Customize your profile design</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Gravatar extends the reach of your Instagram bio, so it’s very important to customize your profile to mirror your brand identity. With control over design elements such as background colors and imagery, you can align your digital profile across all social media platforms, ensuring a consistent brand journey throughout.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-29.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1350\" /><em>Gravatar custom color background</em>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-30.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1351\" /><em>Gravatar custom background image</em>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. w.link</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-31.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1352\" /><em>w.link homepage</em>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://w.link/\">w.link</a> is a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> tool for creating a “link in bio” page that allows users to deeply personalize the presentation of their links.

Your brand is a mark of your unique value, so giving it more visibility helps you stand out, gives more credibility to your professional resume, and opens up a world of opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might already be thinking about your brand in your daily life, from the way you interact with your peers to the way you present yourself at networking events. But as we know, for a brand to be truly successful, it has to exist on the internet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do you even <em>start</em> building your personal brand in an online space where everyone is trying to do the same? The answer lies in choosing the right digital tools and platforms that help you hit your branding goals. There are thousands of tools, and not all of them will be right for your needs, which can be daunting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why, to help you in your branding efforts, we gathered the best online tools to streamline this process, ensuring your personal brand reflects your true Unique Value Proposition (USP) and gets the visibility it deserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Website creation tools</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website is the cornerstone of your brand. This is a given if you offer services or have an eCommerce platform, but if your brand centers around your online persona, you might be wondering whether you even need a website if you’re maintaining your social media profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media is powerful for building an audience – there’s no doubt about that. But in reality, a website is still the granddaddy of online presence because of its dynamic and highly customizable nature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media platforms will confine you to work within their limitations, which means you will need to adapt your content style to what works best for their algorithms. It can be hard to present a proper biography, an overview of your work, and evergreen content on such platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a website can be whatever you want it to be – you are in full control of the way it looks and functions, and what content is posted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether showcasing a portfolio, hosting a blog, or highlighting services, your site is where long-lasting impressions are made, and an essential part of creating an effective website lies in picking the right tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Build your website on WordPress.com</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1308\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress.com homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> is <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">the most popular Content Management System</a> (CMS), and it’s used by brands like <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>, and <a href=\"https://about.meta.com/\">Meta</a>. If you want to build a site with WordPress, we recommend choosing <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a> as your trusted hosting provider, as it comes with built-in security and analytics tools and automatic updates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the technicalities taken care of, you’ll have the time and opportunity to build a great site that fully reflects your personal brand and professional goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several tiers to WordPress.com, but the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/\">Creator plan</a> is the best option for professionals as it allows you to add unlimited plugins and themes. On the other hand, the integration with <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> gives you essential tools to track engagement, monitor traffic sources, and understand your target audience&#8217;s demographics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1309\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress.com pricing</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Creator plan, it is very easy to get started, and if you’re serious about personal branding, having unlimited access to plugins and themes will be extremely helpful. Customize to your heart&#8217;s content with design options that resonate with your personal aesthetic, or extend functionality with plugins that offer everything from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to social media integration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its automatic updates, scheduling abilities, and built-in analytics, WordPress.com lets you spend more time creating brand-centric content instead of worrying about admin tasks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add eCommerce functionality with WooCommerce</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-2.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1310\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WooCommerce homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the beautiful things about WordPress is that you can easily turn your website into an online store thanks to <a href=\"https://woo.com/\">WooCommerce</a> – the eCommerce platform <a href=\"https://barn2.com/blog/woocommerce-stats/#:~:text=The%20wordpress.org%20plugin%20repository,on%20the%20internet%20use%20WooCommerce.\">used by more than 4 million websites worldwide</a> to effectively sell their products and services online!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interactive commercial platform comes with many useful features, such as the option to add customer reviews to your product, build beautiful and categorized product galleries, upsell and cross-sell products and services, and fully customize product and checkout pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to branch out to eCommerce, we recommend opting for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/#:~:text=power%20of%20WooCommerce.-,Entrepreneur,-Build%20an%20online\">Entrepreneur plan</a> on WordPress.com, as it’s specially developed for people who want a full-fledged online store.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-3.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1311\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress.com pricing plans</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Build a newsletter</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Email marketing is powerful and still very popular among digital marketers. In fact, this marketing strategy is one of the most profitable, with a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/804656/email-roi-perception/\">mind-boggling ROI of $36 for every dollar spent</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email gives you a direct line of communication with your audience and builds a longer-lasting relationship, which is especially true with newsletters. A periodic newsletter filled with interesting how-to guides, industry insights, or inspiring success stories not only provides immense value but also bolsters engagement with your brand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com includes a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/newsletter/\">newsletter feature</a> with every plan, and you can easily include one anywhere on your website by adding a “subscribe” block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-4.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1312\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress subscribe block</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The placement is very important, so we recommend putting this form above the fold on your homepage or as a call to action at the end of a compelling blog post to boost subscription rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"299\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-5.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1313\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example of placing a subscribe option above the fold</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This functionality allows you to convert your blog updates into rich, engaging newsletters. With no cap on the number of emails you can send, WordPress.com hands you the reins to grow your subscriber base unconstrained, unlike other platforms that may restrict your reach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides that, it also allows you to create gated content which is a strategy where exclusive content is provided to subscribers. The only thing you need to do is click on “Set up a paid plan” and a new window will pop up, allowing you to fully customize your paid newsletter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-6.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1314\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Creating a paid newsletter with WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature on WordPress.com helps you reward and retain your most loyal followers, cementing a strong community around your personal brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unify your digital presence across all platforms with Gravatar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-7.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1315\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Gravatar homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When building your personal brand, you need to think of your online identity as a whole, not as different pieces independent of each other. Build your social media presence and blog as a cohesive online existence, which means syncing your information across platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> is an efficient tool that centralizes and streamlines your online identity across the web, powered by your email address.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting started with Gravatar is quick and user-friendly. With just a few steps, you’ll have a unique avatar that follows you from site to site, attaching a familiar face to your online commentary and interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-8.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1316\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example of a Gravatar profile&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of adjusting your profile for each platform, you’ll have a consistent identity everywhere, including important and up-to-date details such as contact information and events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single digital signature allows you to build a consistent online identity, making your personal brand more memorable and credible. By unifying your digital presence, Gravatar alleviates the hassle of managing multiple logins and profiles. This convenience is not only a time-saver but ensures your online identity is uniform and professional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you create your profile, you can fully customize it to fit your needs. Here are some of the great things you can do with Gravatar’s profile editor:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Finetune your profile background with custom colors and images.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-9.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1317\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adding a custom background image to your Gravatar profile</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Connect your verified social media accounts and other profiles.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-10.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1318\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Linking verified accounts to your Gravatar profile</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add customized links to promote blog posts, featured articles, upcoming events, and products.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-11.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1319\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adding different links to your Gravatar profile</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add your contact information so that people can easily get in touch.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-12.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1320\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adding contact information to your Gravatar profile</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a QR code feature so you can quickly share your profile during networking events or put it on your physical business card.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-13.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1321\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>QR code options for Gravatar profiles</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the QR code, you can also generate a short link to put on your social media accounts, serving as a versatile “Link in bio” landing page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leverage the social media platforms that make sense for your brand</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We won’t go into too much detail about the different social media platforms, as you’re probably already aware of the most popular ones. But we do want to highlight two very important rules:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don’t worry about being everywhere. Instead, go where your target audience is.</strong> If you’re building your personal brand as an eCommerce leadership expert, chances are your most loyal audience is on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> rather than <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\">TikTok</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/?hl=bg\">Instagram</a>. On the other hand, if you’re a creative personality, like an artist or a musician, then social media platforms with a younger demographic would be a better place</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be consistent in your posting. </strong>This is a universal rule among social media – you won’t be successful if you’re inconsistent with your posting schedule. What helps here is to create a social media calendar and plan out your content for the next month or two.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing you should remember if you use various platforms is that you want to retain some level of consistency in terms of how you present yourself, and furthermore, it should be easy for people to recognize your personal profile across different profiles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar can help you maintain this consistency by giving users a constantly updated overview of your professional identity, including a list of verified social media profiles like X/Twitter (the official one, not the fish one), TikTok, <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, Instagram, <a href=\"https://bsky.social/\">Bluesky</a>, as well as your personal WordPress website, adding even more credibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other tools for content creation and sharing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistently creating great content is hard! Thankfully, there are plenty of tools to help you out at all stages of the content development process, like the organization and planning, ideation, creation, optimization, and promotion of the final product. With the right tools, you can create a workflow that is tailored to your needs and individual processes, allowing you to be consistent with your production.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tools for organization and content mapping</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/integrations/asana\">Notion</a> and <a href=\"https://asana.com/\">Asana</a> are great for content planning, each offering unique benefits that can result in a more polished and professional brand persona.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-15.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1323\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Notion and Asana integration</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notion&#8217;s all-encompassing workspace allows for meticulous planning, crafting, and cataloging of ideas, ensuring a brand&#8217;s narrative unfolds with precision. Asana guides the creative process with its strong project management tools, improving the content production and delivery process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that the richness of features in <a href=\"https://asana.com/apps/notion-asana\">Notion and Asana</a> comes with a moderate learning curve, but there are many <a href=\"https://forum.asana.com/t/multiple-ways-to-integrate-asana-and-notion-2023-guide/482947\">useful resources by brands</a> and other users, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0rYATuSYnI\">especially on YouTube</a>, to help you get used to the tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, if you’re already familiar with the Gutenberg WordPress Editor, you shouldn’t have any issues with Notion, as their interfaces are very similar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Google Trends for ideation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-16.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1324\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Google Trends homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diving into <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a>&#8216; ocean of insights reveals a highly valuable tool that offers a glimpse into the collective consciousness. By leveraging such data, brands can adjust their content to match audience interests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interpreting the peaks and valleys of trending topics leads to informed decisions that anchor a content strategy in the present. For instance, a digital marketer might spot an emerging trend in sustainable living and weave this theme into their blog articles, social media posts, and podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Image and video editor tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a study by the US Chambers of Commerce, <a href=\"https://gitnux.org/branding-statistics/#:~:text=The%20US%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce,recognition%20by%20up%20to%2080%25.\">55% of first impressions of brands are visual</a>, which is another proof of how important your visual representation is. It needs to be engaging, unique, and, most importantly, represent your personal values and best qualities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone is a designer but thankfully, there are tools to help every single professional to create a consistent visual brand. One of the most prominent platforms to do that is <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/en_gb/\">Canva</a>, which offers a library of templates, photos, and illustrations that can be customized to align with your personal brand’s visual theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-17.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1325\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Canva design tool homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canva Pro, the premium version, extends these capabilities with additional features like brand kits and background removal, providing an even more tailored design experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For people looking to enhance their video editing skills, <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html\">Adobe Premiere Rush</a> is a free mobile and desktop app that offers various features to help your brand grow. Its built-in camera, for example, allows for high-quality video capture, while intuitive editing tools help edit and share from anywhere, ensuring your visual narrative remains cohesive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-18.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1326\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adobe Premiere Rush homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For budding personal brands, this tool simplifies the creation of professional-looking content that can resonate with audiences across various platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>URL Shorteners</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>URLs can be very long which makes the process of integrating them troublesome and not aesthetically pleasing. To resolve this, you can use a URL shortener. These are smart tools that allow you to create custom links with your brand name and can also track engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great URL-shortening tool is <a href=\"https://www.rebrandly.com/\">Rebrandly</a> – an AI platform with more than 100 popular integrations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-19.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1327\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rebrandly homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works by selecting a relevant domain name related to your brand and using it as a consistent base for all your short links. This practice not only reinforces brand visibility but also offers detailed analytics insights to evaluate the effectiveness of your shared content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using these analytics can transform raw data into strategic action. By examining click patterns and traffic sources, you can fine-tune your content scheduling and distribution strategies to better capture your audience&#8217;s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Monitor and refine your results with analytics tools</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a personal brand is a continuous process, and analytical tools can provide you with helpful performance indicators. These tools clarify which areas of your personal branding strategy are thriving and which require refinement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those just starting out on their personal branding journey, focusing on key analytics like engagement rate, follower growth over time, and website conversions can be incredibly insightful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most social media platforms come with their own analytics dashboards that show metrics such as engagement rates, best-performing content by reach, and follower demographics. These data points highlight which content truly resonates with your audience, informing not only what you create but also how you can create deeper connections. You can then use these insights by experimenting with content types and posting times, and then measure the changes in engagement for continuous improvement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, when open rates for your newsletter seem low, consider A/B testing with different subject lines or content structures. Track the subsequent open and click-through rates to identify the most engaging approach, thus maintaining a dynamic and relevant correspondence with your audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to website analytics, <a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?service=analytics&passive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Fweb%2F%23&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Fweb%2F&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin\">Google Analytics</a> is the industry standard. However, for WordPress users, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> offers an accessible alternative and it’s included in both the Creator and Entrepreneur plans with WordPress.com. It provides intuitive metrics such as daily visitors, page views, and top-performing pages, all critical in gauging the traction of your online content without the daunting complexity of Google&#8217;s service.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"362\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-20.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1328\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jetpack homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conclude each analysis session with a commitment to apply what you&#8217;ve learned.

Hi Jamie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:08] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Hey there. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very good. Thank you for joining me today. If you haven&#8217;t checked out what Jamie&#8217;s been doing, Jamie has had a really interesting career in the WordPress space. We&#8217;re going to talk about that. We&#8217;ll talk about his YouTube channel, and how he&#8217;s managed to grow that over the last couple of years. Before we do that Jamie, I wonder if you could introduce yourself, give us your quick WordPress bio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> So quick WordPress bio. I&#8217;ve been running this business, Pootlepress for 14 years. Prior to that though, I had a corporate career in technical, both public businesses and private businesses, running businesses. But always in publishing, and in software publishing. I always say that because people just see me as a YouTuber these days, so I want people to understand there&#8217;s a bit more background to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last 14 years, I&#8217;ve been running Pootlepress. And we started off as a training business, and then we morphed into a product business. Built some plugins, which we still provide. And then over the last three years, I&#8217;ve been committing to creating content, primarily over YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Tell us a little bit about Pootlepress. What were the bits and pieces that you got yourself involved in? And are you a coder? Do you write the code, or did you write the code yourself? Do any of those projects still have a life, or have they been shelved for now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> As I said, it started off as a training business, which was literally, I left my previous job. I&#8217;d introduced WordPress into that business, and we had a very expensive development team. We were running a different CMS, which nobody would&#8217;ve heard of, it was called Ektron. But it was about $5,000 per site, per year, so it was, you know, in terms of WordPress. But that was at the very low end of the CMS market. But in terms of WordPress, which is obviously free, it was much more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I introduced WordPress into that business. I could sort of see the market was shaking out a bit. And I looked at the WordPress market from that job, and seeing what was going on. And there were people running training courses in WordPress, but they were charging £500 a day for a WordPress training course, and selling them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought, that&#8217;s quite interesting. But they were going after the sort of corporate market. When I left that business, they gave me a chunk of money, and so I had some time. So I thought, well, I could start a WordPress training business. And so I took out a Google ad, and I launched a WordPress training course, because I knew WordPress really well, because I&#8217;d been using it personally for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I pitched a course, I think it was £99, or something like that. And within half a day I got my first order. I thought, well that&#8217;s interesting, there&#8217;s a market here. And then I ended up running 2 courses a week, with about 15 people in, traveling around the country. I ran them in London, where I&#8217;m based in Chatham. Ended up in Scotland, also Wales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all around the country, running these face-to-face training courses, with people in a room, training people on WordPress. And there&#8217;s nothing quite like seeing face-to-face people using WordPress to understand, I&#8217;m going to talk about the product business in a minute, but understand some of the issues people have with WordPress, when you&#8217;re actually training them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve traveled a lot of miles, and personally trained thousands of people now on WordPress, which is just an incredible experience to have, which you don&#8217;t actually realise until you&#8217;ve sort of gone through it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, from that, we built some plugins, and we&#8217;re going back a while now. So we built some plugins around Woo, as they were, Woo Themes. And, yeah, those plugins are still going, and we still have customers, and they&#8217;re actively supported. And the plugins now we&#8217;re releasing are Gutenberg based, I guess you&#8217;d say. So block based plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were there right at the start of that. So we have a free plugin called Caxton, which nobody understands, but it&#8217;s named after William Caxton. If you&#8217;re English, you probably know that. He was a, the equivalent of Gutenberg but English. And that was launched in Nashville, which Matt Mullenweg demoed actually, as part of his presentation of the launch of Gutenberg. So we were right there, right at the start of Gutenberg. So I&#8217;ve always understood that Gutenberg was going to be a big driver in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds like there&#8217;s a common thread running through quite a bit of that, which is educator basically. Do you have a sort of traditional background in education, or is it just something you find yourself drawn towards and capable of doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:50] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well, I was a tennis coach when I was 19 to 23, to help fund uni education, partly. So played a lot of tennis. And I loved coaching, I loved teaching. And looking back on that experience, that was like, okay, that&#8217;s quite an interesting thing. So I&#8217;m thinking of redoing my, they lapse tennis coaching qualifications, I&#8217;m thinking of retaking them, and going back to it at some point. Because I absolutely love teaching. You realise this as you go through this career, but I love the teaching bit of it, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you find there&#8217;s any, the same level of love for the online teaching? Because when you described your WordPress teaching, it sounded like you were in the room with the people. And so you obviously get that immediate feedback and, you know, it&#8217;s not done via an email saying, thank you, I enjoyed your course, or whatever. You&#8217;re actually seeing people&#8217;s faces light up and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the YouTube content, and all of the other bits and pieces, I just wonder if there&#8217;s any connection between your end users, your students, if you like. Do you get that same warm and fuzzy feeling?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:45] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, definitely is, because the videos on YouTube get tons of comments these days, and I get loads of personal emails, and it&#8217;s the same with teaching people in a room. You know, you teach people in a room and you literally, it sounds a bit overblown, but people do email you and say, this is, you know, I&#8217;ve built a business out of this teaching, thank you. And it&#8217;s changed the direction of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you definitely get that, it&#8217;s different on YouTube, but you definitely get that. Comments are fantastic, and the likes are fantastic as well. So yeah, I mean you do get that sense of fulfillment with it. And I think there&#8217;s, part of it is, tennis coaching is a really, you can teach people to play tennis properly very quickly. You see a lot of people, what I&#8217;m getting to is, I think there&#8217;s lots of ways to teach people well, which I think is a real interest of mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, how you can take a subject, and simplify it down to core elements, so they get the basics and start flying very quickly. With tennis, there&#8217;s like three things you can teach any beginner, to get them playing decent tennis within half an hour, no problem. But you see a lot of coaches will overcomplicate things and people won&#8217;t have the same improvement so quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s the real challenge in WordPress education as well. So I put a huge amount of thought into how I structure my videos in terms of, so people are going to be able to understand them, and do things more easily than just, this is this, this is this, this and this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in terms of my videos, huge amount goes into the preparation of planning how to lay them out, to try and get the best possible outcome for the end user. Whilst at the same time, with YouTube, you have to make them engaging enough that they&#8217;re going to click on the thing in the first place to watch it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot. There&#8217;s kind of multidimensional, creating YouTube videos. You want to be educational, but if you just do a tutorial video, nobody&#8217;s going to potentially watch it, because it&#8217;s going to be boring as heck. So there&#8217;s multi-layers to doing YouTube education stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But you don&#8217;t have like a traditional, I don&#8217;t know, pedagogy. You haven&#8217;t got a, like a teacher training qualification, or anything like that? You&#8217;ve just learned over time the process of creating something that is what you wish to create. And obviously, now that you&#8217;ve got this huge uptick in your subscriber count on the YouTube channel, you&#8217;ve obviously hit on some formula which is working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And I actually don&#8217;t think the traditional approach works on YouTube anyway. I don&#8217;t think you can take, you can try, but I don&#8217;t think if you take a traditional teaching approach, and stick it on YouTube, it&#8217;s not going to work. So I wouldn&#8217;t, you know, if I was putting a video on the Learn WordPress website, I wouldn&#8217;t put that same video on YouTube, because it&#8217;s a completely different context that people are consuming that information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So back in the day when you stumbled across WordPress in the business that you were working with, you probably had no intuition that it was going to work out quite so well, in terms of WordPress&#8217;s ascendancy in the CMS market. How do you feel about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re obviously at this pivotal point, where it feels that there&#8217;s maybe a little bit of slowdown in adoption. We keep talking about this number, this 43% of the internet. I can&#8217;t quite work out what that means, but it&#8217;s a big number. You know, it&#8217;s a giant proportion of the internet. Do you have any intuitions as to whether or not that&#8217;s going to keep going? Would it bother you in any way if it didn&#8217;t keep rising?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:33] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> A few things there, one is, when I was just starting off in WordPress, I could see it was going to fly, because it was starting to gain momentum. But I had all the same, you know, my developers were .net developers that were working for me. They were object orientated focused. They looked at PHP as some sort of dirt in the road, and they thought WordPress was terrible. So they&#8217;re very sneering about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has led a lot of the, I guess, teaching I do as well. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of, people will dismiss WordPress still, for not being, what I&#8217;m trying to say is, WordPress has never won out because it&#8217;s been the best CMS. It&#8217;s won out because of the ecosystem, and the other market drivers that were driving it. Like there were CMSs that had amazing workflows, editorial workflows, back in the day, and WordPress didn&#8217;t have any of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But WordPress won out because of the huge ecosystem, and the fact it was open source, and all these other drivers that were driving it. So I could sort of see that it was going to work back then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of where we are now, it&#8217;s not so much the market size that&#8217;s important to me. There was a slide shared by Noel Tock, as part of his keynote at WordCamp Asia. It was a fascinating slide actually, and it talked about market share, which we know is about 43%, and leveling off a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then he overlaid that slide with search interest. So he looked at how many people were searching. And actually had a really interesting Twitter dialogue with Alex Denning about this as well. And that was basically showing how it grew in 2014, and then now its dived down quite steeply over the last, I think four years, in terms of search interest. So people aren&#8217;t searching for it so much. And then he also overlaid that with number of sites that are being built, which has also gone down a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that, for me, is probably the most important metric, yeah. So that has gone down significantly as well, from where we were at the peak. And then he also overlaid that with another metric, which was maturity of sector. So in terms of how many people are actually engaged in building WordPress sites, or producing WordPress products. And that was kind of still going up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;ve potentially got here is the confluence of a declining market, which we&#8217;re not seeing quite yet. This is the kind of worst case scenario, with over suppliers. So if that is the case, if we do start to see some of that over the next few years, that&#8217;s going to cause a lot of pain to people, because we&#8217;re going to have a declining market, in terms of number sites being built. But we&#8217;ve got lots and lots of suppliers, lots of product people in that sector. So essentially not enough business for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who knows, that&#8217;s conjecture. But my spidey senses are telling me, this is possibly where we&#8217;re potentially at. And I think, if you look at the strategy, there&#8217;s a few other things that play into my mind for this as well. One is, I was at Cloudfest last week in Germany, and a lot of the hosting companies now are pitching towards, deliberately, strategically, pitching towards the agency developer market. That&#8217;s where they&#8217;re going. And there&#8217;s two reasons for that, potential reasons for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is, that&#8217;s where people spend the most money. The second reason for that is, they&#8217;re seeing a contraction of the DIY market, which would be my guess as well. So they&#8217;re seeing their overall market go down, in terms of revenue, my guess. But they&#8217;re seeing everyone trying to go after the agency developer market. Everyone that I speak to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a conversation with Wix this week, because I&#8217;ve had a demo of their product. They are deliberately going after the agency market as well. So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just WordPress that are seeing this pinch at the moment, because I think there&#8217;s some recessional pressure on that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do think it&#8217;s potentially an issue for WordPress, that we&#8217;re, it&#8217;s a question of what is the canary in the mine? And I&#8217;m seeing some of those signals. So yeah, I&#8217;ve got some trepidation of where the market is going to head over the next few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I plumb a little bit further into that, and ask you what the signals are, if you&#8217;re willing to share them? The signals that you&#8217;ve said that you were able to see. Just moments ago, you said that you had this, whatever the canary in the mine was. And you had a few little signals that you thought were illustrative of the general argument that you were making. Can you share those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well, it was just those really. It just the fact that I&#8217;m seeing all the hosting companies that I&#8217;m talking to, because I talk to a lot of hosting companies, and we&#8217;ll probably come on to talk about wordpress.com. But everyone seems to have a strategy of going after the developer agency market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone I speak to, that&#8217;s their strategy. Which makes sense, but it&#8217;s kind of interesting that it seems like that&#8217;s the direction of travel right now. And I don&#8217;t have insider information, in terms of the numbers for hosting companies. That&#8217;s just my view from the outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk recently. Well, certainly over the last three or four years, from various different quarters, all about the sort of shattering of the community. And I think it was, maybe it was Joost, the person, as opposed to Yoast the company. Or maybe it was Marieke, I can&#8217;t remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea that the community is sort of heading in two different directions. You&#8217;ve got this philanthropic side of the community, who pour lots and lots of their personal free time into the project, and wish it to grow in that way. And then you&#8217;ve got the other side, which is driven more by profit, and about how these two sides, in their estimation at least anyway, are getting further and further apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so they&#8217;re having to shout across this void. And the void gets further and further, so that the shouting has to be done louder and louder. The takeaway from that, I guess is that, if you&#8217;ve got a community which isn&#8217;t working, those two sides are not working in tandem, that&#8217;s also a problem I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It was also interesting, because at Cloudfest, lots of hosting companies were there, because Joost was there actually. I was chatting to him and he was saying, actually one of the interesting things is that they need WordPress to succeed. If these like Wix, and Squarespace, and Shopify, if those guys start winning out, that&#8217;s going to affect the hosting company&#8217;s revenue as well. Because those are closed systems, that don&#8217;t host on their systems. There&#8217;s a lot at play in making WordPress work really, at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. He wrote a piece just the other day on the Post Status blog, all about how the hosting companies are, well, in many cases they&#8217;ve got their own onboarding system, and they&#8217;ve got their own page builder, or something adjacent to a page builder. And I think his central argument was, would it be a good idea if, rather than having these sort of rival system, so if you go with hosting company x, you&#8217;re tied in because you&#8217;ve bought into their package, and you understand their tooling and what have you. And if you go with hosting company y, you&#8217;re locked in over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think his central argument was, we need WordPress to succeed, not the proprietary bits and pieces within your own systems. And in order to do that, would it be a good idea to spend less on your proprietary things, and put that investment back into, I don&#8217;t know, Five for the Future or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:34] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s a fair point. The onboarding of WordPress has been mooted a few times in the last few weeks as well. And it&#8217;s one of the big, when you train people, you realise there&#8217;s many hurdles of friction in terms of WordPress, which it&#8217;d be great to have solved, like domain names and hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you go to a hosting page, and that&#8217;s the first hurdle. You&#8217;re like, you get the average person and. Well, you compare the experience of setting up a website on Canva, and setting up a website through any WordPress host. And Canva, it&#8217;s five minutes and they, my cats could do it frankly, it&#8217;s so easy. Whereas WordPress, you have pricing tables with all sorts of things in, which are like object cash and, oh, what was that? Do I need some of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a world of difference in terms of the friction between WordPress and some of these no-code solutions out there. And I know historically, WordPress has always batted these things off. My worry is that might not last forever, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s probably where it needs to be. That&#8217;s the competition. I had this conversation with the head of Influencer Marketing at Wix. They&#8217;ve got 500 people in marketing at Wix. I think they&#8217;ve got 200 on the influencer, no, that can&#8217;t be right. But they&#8217;ve signed up about 400 influencers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And I know we always talk about Wix, and the fact that they put huge amounts of money into marketing. But you compare that to WordPress, who historically have been development companies, with the odd marketing person appended on the side of it. And they&#8217;re really serious. They&#8217;re really serious, and they&#8217;ve got this, quite a cool product that&#8217;s aimed at agency market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do think that the opposition is lining up their ducks really well at the moment. If you were doing a competitor analysis, you look at, you know, I think Canva is a competitor to the brochure market. I&#8217;ve been saying this for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve got a website builder. If they want to, they can go after a lot of the brochure market, which is a lot of WordPress business. Wix, doing some really cool stuff with their Wix Studio stuff. It&#8217;s really slick. Obviously Shopify, going great guns. And then you compare this to WordPress at the moment. I worry how quickly WordPress can react.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say I was watching your WP Builds chat today, and you were saying, what happens if it goes down to 40 and then 35? Let&#8217;s say, that did happen. Is WordPress match fit to react to that? And my worry is, at the moment, we are not, because we haven&#8217;t had to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting point, isn&#8217;t it? We literally haven&#8217;t had to be. It&#8217;s been growth, upon growth, upon growth, year on year. And obviously these rival platforms, Wix et al, they&#8217;ve obviously also had growth year, on year, on year. It hasn&#8217;t been of the same magnitude, but in terms of finance, and the bottom line, it has been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if they can employ a sophisticated marketing team, that can put adverts, you know, in the Super Bowl and things like that, then that&#8217;s going to be a very difficult hurdle to overcome. Because if people do stop Googling for WordPress, or it just, you know, the mind share just disappears, and whenever somebody thinks about a website, that little three letter word pops out of everybody&#8217;s mouth. Oh yeah, Wix, I&#8217;ve heard of that. That&#8217;s going to be hard to compete with. And I think you&#8217;re right, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:31] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> If you compare brand searches, I mean, Canva is the big one. Canva completely dwarfs. You know, I think actually, if I was Wix, I&#8217;d be scared silly of Canva, frankly. I think Canva is such a behemoth in terms of it&#8217;s got, I think it&#8217;s got 165 million monthly users now. Generating cash, always been profitable, and people have grown up with it, people are using it. So, you know, my kids know how to build a website, because they&#8217;ve used Canva. And it&#8217;s the same interface, so there&#8217;s no learning curve. So, personally, I think Canva, if they wanted to, they could go and eat a lot of the Squarespace, and a lot of the Wix market, and a lot of the WordPress brochure market, if they wanted to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canva have got an event coming up. The Canva Create event, which is titled Changing Work, or something like that. So we&#8217;ll see if they, because they have a, like a one page website builder in Canva at the moment. Pretty slick. You can only build a one page website, so it&#8217;s very limited. If they extend that, then that&#8217;s going to be a really interesting thing to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You clearly are fairly optimistic. Well, I say you are, obviously we&#8217;ve just had the conversation that we&#8217;ve just had. But, given the content that you are creating, I suppose there must be a part of you which is optimistic about WordPress&#8217;s future as well. Because your YouTube channel, and we will link to everything that we mention in the show notes, so you can check that out on the WP Tavern website. We&#8217;ll link to all of Jamie&#8217;s bits and pieces, properties and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;ve been creating a YouTube channel. I don&#8217;t know quite how far that goes back. But I think it&#8217;s fair to say that, at the moment, you&#8217;ve got lots of heads turning in your direction. The subscriber count is on a fairly rapid rise. So bravo, well done for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the content, that I&#8217;ve seen at least anyway, is very much aligned with kind of Core WordPress. What can WordPress out the box do, without needing to bundle a bunch of plugins? So given that you are doing that, you must have some confidence in its capacity to challenge the likes of Wix and Squarespace, or maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I mean it&#8217;s miles ahead of those things at the moment. It is important to say that, in terms of how many people are using it, and market share. I was just talking about where I look at it from a, if we were starting today, where we&#8217;re at in terms of just the marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think WordPress is in a place where it needs to step up a gear, which it&#8217;s doing. And that&#8217;s partly why I&#8217;m optimistic about it. So, you know, my videos, a lot of them are like, I do some website recreations where I take a famous website, and I show you how to rebuild it using just Core WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m hugely optimistic about it. It&#8217;s got some hurdles to get over. But the core, imagine if we didn&#8217;t have Gutenberg right now. Imagine where we&#8217;d be if we didn&#8217;t have Gutenberg. I know there&#8217;s lots of people that don&#8217;t like Gutenberg, but imagine that situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually also, interestingly, WordPress has doubled, and I&#8217;m not saying this is down to Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s doubled its market share since Gutenberg was released. So at the very least, it hasn&#8217;t harmed the growth of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the content that you are creating is around the block editor, and what have you. I&#8217;d love to get into the process of that, because your videos, and again, pause this, go and watch some of Jamie&#8217;s content. You&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about as soon as you&#8217;ve got three minutes into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You obviously put a real value on quality. I&#8217;m imagining there&#8217;s quite a lot of editing and retakes, and all of that. You&#8217;ve mentioned before that you spend a long time planning everything out. Why are you doing this? What is the point of having a YouTube channel? What do you get out of it, aside from the pleasure that you may derive? What&#8217;s your north star with that project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:44] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, well, originally it was just to create some content that kind of countered the narrative that you couldn&#8217;t do stuff in the block editor, I think, probably. So I just started producing some content just with, I guess a slight experiment, I suppose. And then it started to get some traction and feedback, so I carried on. I just carried on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was actually a post by Chris Lema, that talked about trying to become a content machine. I think it was something like that. Which kind of inspired me to really start committing towards it. And I could just sense that there was something happening in terms of creating the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s got to the point where it&#8217;s generating revenue. It&#8217;s generating more revenue than the other bits of the business, which wasn&#8217;t the plan. But then people start emailing you and saying, well, we&#8217;d like to sponsor this. We&#8217;d like to put our name to this content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last two contracts I&#8217;ve signed, in terms of the description of what it was, one had talent in quotes at the top, which is bizarre. And the other had influencer, which is really bizarre. And now that&#8217;s driving revenue. It&#8217;s driving revenue back to the product business, and it&#8217;s driving revenue back to the training business. That was not the intention of why I started it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s really fascinating. So it was just done out of a desire to put content out there. It transformed itself into something that was getting the eyeballs. And then I presume, off the back of that, yeah, the sponsorship, emails start arriving and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A difficult decision must have been had, or a difficult decision must have been, had to have been made at some point. How much time does Jamie put into this in the future, you know? Okay, it&#8217;s successful now. Will it continue to grow? Should I be concentrating on the business? Should I be concentrating on the videos? Yeah, I guess you&#8217;ve got to sit the family down and have that conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:21] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well it&#8217;s a bit strange to say, you know, when you&#8217;re 50, what do you do for a living? And you have to say, I&#8217;m a YouTuber. It was hard enough to explain to my mother what I did in WordPress, and now it&#8217;s, she just looks at me blankly like I&#8217;m crazy. But I think the other thing is, I absolutely love it. So it wasn&#8217;t like I was drawn to the challenge of creating interesting creative content, and that was the prime thing that got me to create lots of video content. I absolutely love the creative process, and challenge of creating video content. So it was like, oh okay, this is maybe what I should have been doing a while back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Does the sponsorship bring with it a different approach to creating content? What I mean by that is, when you were just doing the content because you enjoyed doing the content, you could put things out on any schedule, I guess. You know, miss a month, it doesn&#8217;t matter, it was just a bit of fun. But then as soon as the sponsorships start to come in, I guess you&#8217;ve got to be a bit more methodical about it, bit more timely about it, and they&#8217;re going to want a return on that investment. So has it changed your opinion of it, as a thing that you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:21] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Not yet, but I&#8217;m quite early into it, so ask me maybe in a couple of years time. And I think the thing with the sponsorship, all the sponsored content I&#8217;m doing so far is stuff that I&#8217;ve pitched it to them actually, a lot of it. Even though people will email me a lot these days, and ask for sponsored content. I&#8217;ll often have ideas of an interesting piece of content, and then, because I know most people in the WordPress market now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And having a YouTube channel is a great way to network, by the way. So you know, for example, a good example is with the guys over at Stellar. I&#8217;ve done a few pieces with them. But I had the idea, wouldn&#8217;t it be great fun to do a piece of content which was, I think we&#8217;re going to call it, I hired an ethical hacker to break into my website and here&#8217;s what happened. You know, which is like a really interesting idea as a piece of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve actually found an ethical hacker, he&#8217;s based in Malaga, and I&#8217;m going to go and see him, and that&#8217;ll be part of the video as well. The interesting thing about the sponsorship is how you take an idea and make it interesting, and compelling for people watching the content, so they still want to watch it. That&#8217;s a really creative challenge as well. But in terms of, it hasn&#8217;t changed my opinion yet, but I&#8217;m very early to the financial bit of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well let&#8217;s hope you still maintain the enthusiasm. What does the process look like then? You mentioned that you&#8217;ve come up with some innovative titles, and you&#8217;re obviously telephoning people up, and trying to find hackers here, there, and everywhere. But what is the process, to put out a half an hour, an hour long piece of content? Just give us an insight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I think everybody has the impression that, oh, YouTube, it&#8217;s easy. There, he&#8217;s staring at the camera, he&#8217;s talking, he&#8217;s making it up as he goes along. And I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not like that. I&#8217;m sure there must be hours, and hours, and hours. What does it take to put out one of your videos?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:49] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> As an example, I&#8217;ve got a video coming out today with wordpress.com. It&#8217;s a five minute video and it probably took two days. That sort of magnitude. There&#8217;s like the initial idea, and then I always, always now, get the title and thumbnail sorted first. If anyone&#8217;s going to do this stuff, you&#8217;ve got to do that first with YouTube. It sounds a bit crass, but you&#8217;ve just got to do it. So get the packaging right. And I think only once you&#8217;ve got that right do you know the video&#8217;s going to fly. So that&#8217;s a really good process to go through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it&#8217;s just around, planning is everything, and the creative idea behind the flow of the video. I&#8217;ve developed a blueprint now, which I use on a lot of my videos, which is about having a hook, and then adding loops into the video, so you keep people engaged throughout the video. So it&#8217;s almost like this layer that you layer on top of a video. So when you&#8217;re seeing the video, you&#8217;re seeing somebody talk about something, but actually there&#8217;s hopefully a blueprint behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s a story in there somewhere. There&#8217;s a methodology behind it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:39] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> That is getting natural to me now. So when I&#8217;m planning videos, I understand, I don&#8217;t have to think. When you first start doing YouTube, you have to think about everything like that, because it&#8217;s not natural. It is to some people, but it&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t to me. So you&#8217;ve got to plan it, in terms of that blueprint. How to structure it. Hook people at the start, keep them engaged throughout, plus educate them along the journey. So there&#8217;s quite a lot going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Do you do sponsor bits inside the video? What I mean is, is the sponsorship clearly defined in the content that you do? So there&#8217;s an ad for hosting company x, or whatever it may be. And then you get back to being in the video, it&#8217;s Jamie talking to the camera and what have you. Or are you open to creating sponsored videos about particular product or company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:17] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> So both really. So at the moment I&#8217;ve got pre-rolls that go on the front of all my videos, which is, at the moment, InstaWP are sponsoring that space. But I&#8217;ve also done videos where I do website recreation, with certain tools. So I&#8217;ve done one with Kadence and GiveWP, where I recreated the Charity Water website using their tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they give me a challenge, and I try and rebuild it using Kadence and their tools. And I did one with Spectra One as well. So that&#8217;s kind of how that works. The one I&#8217;m doing with Stellar and SolidWP will be, it&#8217;ll be sponsored by them and it&#8217;s going to be, this is the challenge, but this is what happens when we try and hack into a website without any security, this is what happens when we try and hack into a website with some security. It kind of varies in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so you&#8217;ve got a, you can, approach Jamie if you want to make content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:01] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And I&#8217;ve also got, if you go to my YouTube sponsorship page, I&#8217;ve also got this series of videos going on at the moment where we give my daughters a challenge with a product. We&#8217;ve got five people lined up actually, who have signed up. And the first one we did was Kadence AI. So, can Meg and Lily build a website in 10 minutes, using Kadence AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s another sponsorship opportunity as well. And that&#8217;s them using the Kadence tools to try and do a task, and we just film them doing the task. And I think that&#8217;s really interesting from a content point of view, but it&#8217;s also really interesting from a product point of view. Because they&#8217;re beginners, they&#8217;re not web pros, how beginners use their plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really fascinating, and you get your family involved as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:37] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well they get the money actually with that one as well, because they&#8217;re both at universities now. I&#8217;ve got another daughter called Hetty who wants in on the action, she hasn&#8217;t done it yet. But yeah, the money goes to them to fund their accommodation at uni, which is really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is so nice. That&#8217;s so great. One thing that we should mention is, of course, and you did mention it before. But you know you&#8217;re doing something right. Well, you didn&#8217;t mention this bit before, but you know you&#8217;re doing something right when people such as Matt Mullenweg drop your name in the State of the Word. And off the back of, I guess being seen by Matt, you&#8217;re now creating content, or you&#8217;re about to create content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:11] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ve done three, fourth one going out today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So this is wordpress.com. You&#8217;re making videos in that space. How&#8217;s that process going? Are you enjoying that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:19] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s great. Basically it&#8217;s a series of videos called Build and Beyond. So I&#8217;m partnering with them for a series of videos, kind of aimed at the sort of developer agency market again, which is interesting. Because there&#8217;s lots of stuff going on in wordpress.com that people don&#8217;t know about. So it&#8217;s trying to show some of that stuff, but also just kind of speak to the broader market about the cool stuff you can do with WordPress actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And obviously I&#8217;ve got resources of some amazing people in wordpress.com to lean on, in creating content. It&#8217;s kind of like a fabulous thing to happen. And obviously it&#8217;s great from my point of view, because it gets my name on wordpress.com, I&#8217;m on their blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hopefully it&#8217;s adding value to their brand, which is the idea. Part of my plan with that is to kind of shine a light on some of the cool stuff happening in WordPress, in the broader community. So hopefully a video&#8217;s going out in a few hours, which talks about some of the developers you should follow in the WordPress ecosystem. It&#8217;s trying to shine a light on the cool stuff that&#8217;s happening out there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I don&#8217;t quite know how to phrase this question. I&#8217;ll ask it, and maybe I&#8217;ll change the wording of it. Do you think there&#8217;s something different about you. Do you think the route to success, in the way that you are doing it with WordPress content, do you think that&#8217;s something you were born with, if you know what I mean? Do you have that capacity? Were you always able to be a raconteur? Can you control the room? Have you always had the ability to talk? Do you understand kind of where I&#8217;m going? Do you believe that this is something that anybody could do with a little bit of hard work and patience, or is there something a bit special about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:39] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> There&#8217;s nothing special about me, but there&#8217;s definitely, a lot of my roles in, especially before Pootlepress, were being the communicator between the technical people, and the commercial people. I was that person that could take technical ideas, and then translate them to non-technical people, so they could understand from a business point of view why they were important to do. So I&#8217;ve definitely enjoyed being in that spot, taking really complex ideas, and make simple for people to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it also takes a certain amount courage to push through with something like this. Because the idea of putting things out, and thinking, well, I&#8217;ve made it, people will watch it. That takes a certain level of courage I think, because it&#8217;s easy to think that people will watch it, feel great disappointment if they don&#8217;t. But in your case, it didn&#8217;t turn out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:22] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> No. We have this running joke with my wife, which is, there&#8217;s three types of people in the world. People that think they&#8217;re worse than they actually are. People think they&#8217;re about right, in terms of their opinion of themself, and people that think they&#8217;re better than they actually are. My wife thinks she&#8217;s slightly worse than, she&#8217;s got far more talent than she thinks she has. I think I&#8217;m probably slightly above, which I think helps in this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think that&#8217;s great. Thank you for joining me today, Jamie. It&#8217;s been a real pleasure. It&#8217;s been an absolute delight watching your videos, and watching your popularity grow. Let&#8217;s hope that if we were to have the same conversation in 2, 3, 4, 5 years time, it would still be on an upward spike. Let&#8217;s hope that&#8217;s the case. Jamie, thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:02] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Thanks very much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/JamieMarsland/videos\">Jamie Marsland</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie has a varied background in technical corporate leadership, and has been guiding Pootlepress for over a decade. Initially a training service, <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/\">Pootlepress</a> has become a product-focused company known for its WordPress plugins. Jamie&#8217;s depth of experience in the industry is increasingly overshadowed by his visibility as a YouTuber, where, as you’ll hear, much of his attention is now focussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode we cover some new ground. We talk about a critical issue facing WordPress today, the fierce competition from platforms like Canva and Wix, and the marketing hurdles that WordPress must navigate to maintain its market share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore Jamie&#8217;s unconventional path to becoming a content creator, discussing how he went from teaching tennis to teaching tech, and how he&#8217;s leveraged YouTube to grow his audience and business. His perspective is that it’s important to make technical concepts accessible and easy to understand. Making his content is a lot of work, most of which happens behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into this a little more deeply and Jamie shares his strategies for effective video creation, from planning to execution, along with his thoughts on sponsored content and its place in the YouTube ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about the future of WordPress, content creation, or the dynamics of digital learning, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/\">Pootlepress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/caxton/\">Caxton</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/state-of-the-word/\">State of the Word 2023</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/JamieMarsland/videos\">Jamie&#8217;s YouTube channel</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/session/the-future-of-wordpress/\">Noel Tock at WordCamp Asia</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/98-marieke-van-de-rakt-on-uniting-the-wordpress-community-for-a-stronger-future\">Marieke van de Rakt on Uniting the WordPress Community for a Stronger Future</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/the-future-is-open-source/\">The future is open-source</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/canva-create/\">Canva Create</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: reCAPTCHA V2 vs V3: Key Differences (And the Best Alternative)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=283843\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://akismet.com/blog/recaptcha-v2-vs-v3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23653:\"<p>Every website needs spam protection. If you’re part of an enterprise&#8209;level team, you know the shocking number of resources companies actually have to devote to this. Without some kind of software that helps filter out spam and bot activity, teams might spend more time dealing with fake activity than real&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/\">reCAPTCHA</a> is one of the most popular options for organizations that want to protect their websites from spam. It’s relatively easy to implement on most websites — you just need to know which version is best for your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>However, it can disrupt the user experience and provide less&#8209;than&#8209;perfect results. That’s why anti&#8209;spam solutions like <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet</a> (which works completely in the background with AI technology) are quickly becoming the preferred option for organizations looking to streamline the UX and maximize the effectiveness of their online presence. We’ll discuss that option a bit&nbsp;later.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we’ll introduce you to reCAPTCHA and help you pick the right version for your organization’s needs. We’ll also show you to Akismet, the best reCAPTCHA alternative on the market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283843\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n<p>You’re probably familiar with a CAPTCHA, even if you don’t know it by name. CAPTCHA stands for ‘Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans&nbsp;Apart’.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1102\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image.png\" alt=\"reCAPTCHA homepage with information about the tool\" class=\"wp-image-283844\" />\n\n\n\n<p>That name is a mouthful, but it describes precisely what a CAPTCHA does. It’s a system you can implement <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-add-wordpress-contact-form/\">alongside forms</a> to ensure that only humans can use them. Created at the turn of the 21st century, a basic CAPTCHA simply distorted letters and asked the user to identify them. The technology has continued to evolve over the years and is now known as reCAPTCHA. That’s what we’re looking at today. Google purchased this technology in 2009 and continually works to improve upon it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>As a website admin, if there’s a submission that can’t pass a reCAPTCHA test, then you may be dealing with a&nbsp;bot.</p>\n\n\n<p>Or a human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, as reCAPTCHA has evolved to stay ahead of the ever&#8209;increasing sophistication of bots, the tests have become so complicated that, in many cases, real humans are prevented from using&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the potential drawbacks, systems like this are essential in today’s digital landscape. Any popular website deals with huge numbers of spam attacks, including unwelcome comments, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/forum-spam/\">fake registrations</a>, and login&nbsp;attempts.</p>\n\n<p>Quality reCAPTCHA systems are capable of filtering out many bot submissions. You’ll still need to deal with spam, but in much smaller&nbsp;numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Though not originally invented by the organization, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reCAPTCHA</a> is now a free service (with some limitations for enterprises) that Google provides, and that you can implement for any website or web application. You even get to choose between different versions, depending on the type of protection you want to&nbsp;implement.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1274\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-1.png\" alt=\"reCAPTCHA v3 vs reCAPTCHA v2\" class=\"wp-image-283846\" />\n\n\n<p>These versions offer very different experiences and reCAPTCHA implementations. In the next section, we’ll explore what those differences are, and discuss the evolution from the first version of reCAPTCHA to the current&nbsp;model.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-evolution-of-recaptcha-from-v1-to v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The evolution of reCAPTCHA from V1 to&nbsp;V3</h2>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA has evolved fairly dramatically since its inception. The changes in how the reCAPTCHA system works reflect new developments in the technology used to combat bots and spam. Let’s take a look at the three major&nbsp;versions.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA V1</h3>\n\n\n<p>The first version of reCAPTCHA launched in 2007, and it displayed images with distorted textual characters. You can still see this type of CAPTCHA in many places on the web. You’re unable to copy the text, and the letters are heavily distorted to deter programs that might try to analyze the image’s&nbsp;contents.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"760\" height=\"294\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-2.png\" alt=\"CAPTCHA with instructions on entering two words\" class=\"wp-image-283847\" />\n\n\n<p>This type of CAPTCHA also fulfilled a secondary purpose. A lot of the images of text were taken from digitized books. If you resolved this type of CAPTCHA, you not only proved that you’re human, but you also helped software better recognize the language in digitized&nbsp;books.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, this is the most straightforward type of reCAPTCHA you can implement for your organization. It’s relatively easy for most people to solve (as CAPTCHAs should be). However, it’s also become outdated over&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p>These days, there’s plenty of software and bots that are sophisticated enough to recognize the letters that images contain. That means reCAPTCHA V1 is no longer an effective&nbsp;option.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA V2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA V2 is where Google stepped in. They acquired the software in 2009 and launched V2 in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>This version of reCAPTCHA offered a <em>very </em>different experience from anything else on the market. Instead of having visitors solve a puzzle to prove they’re human, reCAPTCHA V2 shows a simple checkbox that says, “I am not a&nbsp;robot”.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"948\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-3.png\" alt=\"reCAPTCHA with a checkbox for I am not a robot\" class=\"wp-image-283848\" />\n\n\n<p>As an end user, all you have to do is click on the checkbox. reCAPTCHA V2 analyzes the user behavior during that process, and only presents further challenges if the system suspects it’s dealing with a&nbsp;bot.</p>\n\n<p>Those subsequent challenges typically involve image recognition tasks. reCAPTCHA V2 might ask you to select all the images that contain a specific element, like vehicles or&nbsp;stairs.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"874\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-4.png\" alt=\"grid of images to review\" class=\"wp-image-283849\" />\n\n\n<p>The goal of these changes was to make CAPTCHAs more user&#8209;friendly. reCAPTCHA V1 is often frustrating for visitors, since it’s easy to mistake some of the characters shown in the&nbsp;images.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, visitors often needed multiple tries to resolve a V1 reCAPTCHA. With V2, some visitors will still need to solve rote verification challenges, but most can just check a box and&nbsp;proceed.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA V3</h3>\n\n\n<p>V3 is the latest version of reCAPTCHA and the current industry standard. It launched in 2018, and it offers human verification that works entirely in the background of a&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n<p>With reCAPTCHA V3, visitors don’t need to solve any challenges or tick any verification boxes. The software analyzes user behavior and gives each visitor a score. Depending on the score, it can determine whether a visitor is a human or a&nbsp;bot.</p>\n\n<p>As the administrator, you can lower or raise the threshold for human verification with reCAPTCHA V3. The software gives you control over how strict it is, and whether it should completely block traffic it deems to be from&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, reCAPTCHA V3 is better from a user&#8209;experience standpoint. Instead of forcing visitors to interact with a CAPTCHA system or solve random challenges, V3 simply analyzes their behavior behind the scenes. A human visitor may be locked out if they are incorrectly determined to be a bot, but this should be rare (depending on your chosen&nbsp;settings).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understanding-recaptcha v2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding reCAPTCHA&nbsp;V2</h2>\n\n<p>These days, it doesn’t make sense to use reCAPTCHA V1, whether it’s for a small business or an enterprise&#8209;level website. That version of the software is deprecated, which means your choice will be between V2 and V3 (or a completely different&nbsp;alternative).</p>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA V2 aims to minimize the number of visitors who need to solve challenges to prove they’re human. With V2, most visitors will only see a simple checkbox they need to tick to prove that they’re not&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n<p>This can seem like a rudimentary approach, but it works because V2 also analyzes user behavior in the background. If it sees suspicious activity, it will also ask visitors to resolve visual&nbsp;challenges.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, only a small number of human visitors should be presented with those additional challenges. This can be a safer approach than using a CAPTCHA system that works fully in the background because it provides a second chance for humans falsely labeled as robots. Plus, it doesn’t allow the site admin to reduce the level of strictness, as is the case for&nbsp;V3.</p>\n\n\n<p>The downside of reCAPTCHA V2 is that it will inconvenience visitors in some cases. However, presenting challenges can also help to keep your organization’s website safer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Aside from the occasional annoyance for visitors, versions of reCAPTCHA that rely on visual challenges can present accessibility issues. reCAPTCHA offers audio versions of its challenges for visitors with visual impairments, but the system is not&nbsp;perfect.</p>\n\n\n<p>Google provides support for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">implementing reCAPTCHA V2</a> on your website using JavaScript. It’s worth noting that while the service is free, it only supports up to one million assessments per month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>If you do require additional assessments, you’ll need to budget for a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/pricing\">reCAPTCHA Enterprise</a>&nbsp;plan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understanding-recaptcha v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding reCAPTCHA&nbsp;V3</h2>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA V3 is the latest version of the CAPTCHA software. It does away with human verification challenges, and instead uses a score system that works entirely in the&nbsp;background.</p>\n\n<p>When you implement reCAPTCHA V3 to protect a form, it automatically analyzes the behavior of any user who tries to access it. The software uses an algorithm to determine if a visitor is a human or a bot, by scoring them using specific&nbsp;criteria.</p>\n\n<p>The approach of V3 is completely different from previous versions of the software. You can calibrate the scoring system for your site to decide what is an acceptable threshold for determining ‘human behavior’, and block traffic the system thinks is&nbsp;suspicious.</p>\n\n<p>This version of the software offers the most user&#8209;friendly implementation of CAPTCHA. That’s because visitors don’t need to deal with challenges or interact with any elements to prove that they’re&nbsp;human.</p>\n\n<p>The downside of this approach is that it can lead to more false negatives. No bot detection system is perfect, and without challenges, your organization might end up dealing with more spam&nbsp;submissions.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of integration, you can <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3\">implement reCAPTCHA V3</a> on your website using JavaScript. The code is different from V2, and you get a lot of control over how the implementation works and how sensitive it is when it comes to scoring user&nbsp;behavior.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"choosing-between-recaptcha-v2-and v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing between reCAPTCHA V2 and&nbsp;V3</h2>\n\n<p>Any organization with a significant online presence needs some sort of protection against spam and bot activity. reCAPTCHA V2 and V3 are among the most popular options because they’re relatively easy to implement, and they have generous free&nbsp;plans.</p>\n\n<p>Using V3 might seem like the logical option, since it’s the latest version of the reCAPTCHA software. In practice, though, V2 continues to be an incredibly popular version of the&nbsp;software.</p>\n\n<p>Both V2 and V3 provide comprehensive protection from spam for your website, but they do it using two different approaches. Despite being older, V2 offers a more secure experience, since it still implements a challenge system for suspicious&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<p>V3, on the other hand, can be more prone to false positives/negatives. Since you can configure what the software does if it detects suspicious activity, there’s more room for potential human error during the implementation&nbsp;process.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, reCAPTCHA V2 offers a more secure experience that is ideal for sensitive forms. If you have forms dealing with sensitive user data, having the option to present challenges can help you avoid problems like fake ecommerce&nbsp;orders.</p>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA V3 can be incredibly effective, but it prioritizes user experience over higher levels of security. This makes it a better option for less sensitive forms and user submissions, such as comments&nbsp;sections.</p>\n\n<p>You <em>can </em>configure reCAPTCHA V3 to be more strict in detecting bot activity. The downside of this approach is that it can increase the rate of false positives. If you use reCAPTCHA to block bot traffic, and it mistakes a human visitor for a fake one, they’re unlikely to be happy with the&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, there is no single best version of reCAPTCHA. You’ll need to consider the relative strengths and weaknesses of each one to determine which is most appropriate for your website. (There are also alternative tools you can use, which we’ll discuss&nbsp;shortly.)</p>\n\n<p>When it comes time to implement one of these systems, Google provides plenty of useful documentation for both reCAPTCHA V2 and V3. Your organization can set either one up manually, or via plugins if you use a content management system (CMS) like&nbsp;WordPress.</p>\n\n<p>Both versions of reCAPTCHA are free for up to one million validations per&nbsp;month.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"exploring-the-alternatives-to recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exploring the alternatives to&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is not the only option at your disposal. If you’re not happy with the approach that either V2 or V3 uses, then it’s smart to consider <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">alternatives to CAPTCHA technology</a> for your spam&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n<p>While there are a variety of anti&#8209;spam solutions available, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet</a> is the only one that rivals reCAPTCHA in terms of how easy it is to implement <em>and</em> its success rate. With Akismet, you get bot protection with 99.99%&nbsp;accuracy.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1243\" height=\"846\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-5.png\" alt=\"stats about Akismet\'s success\" class=\"wp-image-283850\" />\n\n\n<p>More importantly, Akismet doesn’t rely on challenges to separate humans from bots. It offers a solution that works in the background to protect your website from spam, and it provides a fully free plan for personal websites and&nbsp;blogs.</p>\n\n<p>For professional websites, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">there’s flexible pricing</a>. Small businesses can get the protection they need via the Pro plan for just $9.95 per month (when billed yearly). For <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">enterprise&#8209;level spam protection</a>, organizations can get plans and pricing that’s customized around their specific&nbsp;needs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"akismet-the-leader-in-spam protection\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The leader in spam&nbsp;protection</h2>\n\n<p>No matter which spam protection solution you choose for your organization, it needs to fulfill two key criteria. The first is to protect you against as much spam and bot activity as possible, with the fewest false positives along the way. The second is to protect a strong user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p>The importance of that user experience can’t be discounted. Some CAPTCHA solutions, like reCAPTCHA V2, are aggressive when it comes to presenting challenges after they detect suspicious activity. In some cases, reCAPTCHA V2 can force visitors to solve multiple challenges before giving them the green&nbsp;light.</p>\n\n<p>That aggressive approach to spam detection can keep your website safe. The downside is that it can scare visitors away because solving multiple CAPTCHAs is not an enjoyable&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">Akismet solves this problem</a> by providing behind&#8209;the&#8209;scenes detection based on machine learning. It analyzes data from real spam on over 100 million websites to provide the most accurate detection&nbsp;possible.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1126\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-6.png\" alt=\"Aksimet page with the text \" />\n\n\n<p>Akismet provides simple integration with all kinds of websites, and it’s particularly easy to implement if you’re using WordPress. Your website administrator can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">install the Akismet plugin</a>, activate it, and start filtering spam right&nbsp;away.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1097\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/image-7.png\" alt=\"Akismet plugin listing\" class=\"wp-image-283852\" />\n\n\n<p>Although Akismet filters spam and bot activity in the background, you can also check to make sure it doesn’t flag any real submissions as spam. This is rare, but it sometimes happens, and Akismet learns from these situations to avoid flagging similar activity in the&nbsp;future.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<p>If you still have any questions about spam protection and what solutions to consider, this section will aim to answer them. Let’s start by recapping the key elements of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is a CAPTCHA solution offered by Google. You can choose from reCAPTCHA V2 or V3 for your website, and implement either option using&nbsp;JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Both versions of the software offer unique approaches to how they protect your website from spam. You can use either version for free for up to one million validations per&nbsp;month.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-primary-goal-of-recaptcha-in-website security\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the primary goal of reCAPTCHA in website&nbsp;security?</h3>\n\n<p>The primary goal of reCAPTCHA is to stop spam form submissions. That includes spam comments, brute&#8209;force attacks through login screens, fake payment information, and other types of&nbsp;attacks.</p>\n\n<p>The software does this by helping to distinguish between real interactions on a website and bots. Different versions of reCAPTCHA use unique approaches to achieve this&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-have-captcha-mechanisms-evolved-over-the-years-leading-up-to-recaptcha-v2-and v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How have CAPTCHA mechanisms evolved over the years, leading up to reCAPTCHA V2 and&nbsp;V3?</h3>\n\n<p>Over time, CAPTCHA mechanisms have evolved to rely less on challenges and more on behind&#8209;the&#8209;scenes analysis. With reCAPTCHA V1, visitors were forced to solve challenges to prove they were human. Whereas the newest version of the software (V3) analyzes behavior without any input required from&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-bots-still-bypass-recaptcha-systems-and-if-so-how-do-newer-versions-mitigate this\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can bots still bypass reCAPTCHA systems? And if so, how do newer versions mitigate&nbsp;this?</h3>\n\n<p>CAPTCHA systems are always in a race to stay ahead of newer, stronger bots. There’s a community of malicious actors who work to bypass reCAPTCHA protections, as well as other similar systems. This is because <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-a-spambot/\">spambots</a> and automated attacks can be incredibly lucrative, and there’s significant interest in programs that can bypass well&#8209;known&nbsp;CAPTCHAs.</p>\n\n<p>Newer versions mitigate this risk through continued development. Any CAPTCHA solution you choose needs to get regular updates to both the core software and its spam database, in order to stay ahead of attackers. If the solution you’re using doesn’t do this, it will quickly become&nbsp;outdated.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-i-use-recaptcha-v2-and-v3-simultaneously-for-added security\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I use reCAPTCHA V2 and V3 simultaneously for added&nbsp;security?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, you can use reCAPTCHA V2 and V3 on the same website to protect different pages and assets. Google includes information on how to implement both versions of reCAPTCHA in its developer&nbsp;handbook.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-best-alternative-to recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the best alternative to&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet offers the best alternative to reCAPTCHA for both small business websites and enterprise&#8209;level projects. You can easily implement Akismet on any type of website, but it’s particularly easy to do so if your organization uses&nbsp;WordPress.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-akismetâs-approach-to-spam-protection-differ-from-traditional-captcha methods\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does Akismet’s approach to spam protection differ from traditional CAPTCHA&nbsp;methods?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet uses machine learning to analyze spam from the millions of websites that use it. This gives it access to one of the largest databases in the world for spam and bot activity, which means fewer false&nbsp;positives.</p>\n\n<p>With Akismet, visitors also don’t need to solve challenges to prove they’re human. The software can analyze their submissions and use its training to determine what’s spam and what&nbsp;isn’t.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"akismet-the-most-trusted-solution-for-spam protection\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The most trusted solution for spam&nbsp;protection</h2>\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for the easiest solution to implement with the most accurate results and absolutely zero interference for your visitors, your best choice is Akismet. It’s blocked over 500 billion instances of spam and is used on over 100 million sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA offers some additional customization, but also comes with risks like false positives that lock out real users and an annoying experience that could reduce your conversions. You can integrate Akismet with any system via an open API, or take advantage of its popular, pre&#8209;built plugin for WordPress&nbsp;sites.</p>\n\n\n<p>Many website owners can use Akismet absolutely free. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Explore Akismet plans</a>.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Do The Woo Community: Leveraging WooCommerce for Wyrmwood Gaming with Douglas Costello\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=81053\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://dothewoo.io/leveraging-woocommerce-for-wyrmwood-gaming-with-douglas-costello/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"The Woo team and Douglas discuss Wyrmwood\'s journey, Kickstarter success, challenges of growth, and multi-channel commerce.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2024 09:49:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Donncha: Speculating on what to load next\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://odd.blog/?p=89590546\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://odd.blog/2024/04/10/speculating-on-what-to-load-next/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1974:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speculation-rules/\">Speculative Loading</a> plugin for WordPress is a plugin you should probably try out on your site, especially if you use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\">WP Super Cache</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-boost/\">Jetpack Boost</a> to cache things.

with only the click of a few buttons! Whether it\'s something simple like adding an “author” field to a book review post, or something more complex like the structured data needs of an ecommerce site or marketplace, ACF makes adding fields to your content model easy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Add them anywhere.</strong></p>\n<p>Fields can be added all over WordPress including posts, pages, users, taxonomy terms, media, comments and even custom options pages! It couldn\'t be simpler to bring structure to the WordPress content creation experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Show them everywhere.</strong></p>\n<p>Load and display your custom field values in any theme template file with our hassle-free, developer friendly functions!

Accessibility standards are regularly reviewed and applied, ensuring ACF is able to empower as close to anyone as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Documentation and developer guides.</strong></p>\n<p>Over 10 plus years of vibrant community contribution alongside an ongoing commitment to clear documentation means that you\'ll be able to find the guidance you need to build what you want.</p>\n\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple & Intuitive</li>\n<li>Powerful Functions</li>\n<li>Over 30 Field Types</li>\n<li>Extensive Documentation</li>\n<li>Millions of Users</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Links</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%20plugin%20listing&utm_campaign=ACF%20Website\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%20plugin%20listing&utm_campaign=ACF%20Website\">Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.advancedcustomfields.com\">Support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%20plugin%20listing&utm_campaign=ACF%20Pro%20Upgrade\">ACF PRO</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>PRO</h4>\n<p>The Advanced Custom Fields plugin is also available in a professional version which includes more fields, more functionality, and more flexibility.

De la bibliothèque de polices à la gestion des révisions au sein de l’éditeur de site, en passant par les nombreuses améliorations de performances, WordPress&nbsp;6.5 apportera beaucoup à votre site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;«&nbsp;Regina&nbsp;» apporte également plusieurs outils de développement ayant pour objectif de transformer la façon dont les développeuses et développeurs interagissent avec l’éditeur afin d’étendre le système de blocs. L&rsquo;API de gestion des interactions ouvre un nouveau champ de possibilités tandis que l’API <em><bdo lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Block Bindings</bdo></em> permet de réaliser des connexions dynamiques entre les blocs et les champs personnalisés (ou tout autre type de donnée dynamique). Et ce ne sont que deux exemples des nombreuses évolutions techniques de cette version.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/download/\">Télécharger WordPress 6.5 «&nbsp;Regina&nbsp;»</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Les nouveautés de WordPress&nbsp;6.5</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gérez les polices d’écriture de votre site</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>La nouvelle bibliothèque de polices vous permet de contrôler la typographie de votre site sans avoir à mettre les mains dans le code. Installez, supprimez et activez sans effort vos polices locales ou les polices Google sur votre site, quel que soit votre thème actif. La possibilité d‘inclure des collections de polices personnalisées offre encore plus de choix aux personnes qui créent et administrent des sites WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/Font-Manager-1024x666.png\" alt=\"A stylized view of the font manager; part of the new Font Library feature in WordPress 6.5.\" class=\"wp-image-17147\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Davantage d’informations sur vos révisions de styles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Travaillez sur vos projets de création avec une vision plus complète de ce qui a été fait et de ce sur quoi vous pouvez vous appuyer.

Elle simplifie le processus en réduisant les dépendances à des outils externes, tout en conservant des performances optimales. Utilisez-la pour créer des expériences utilisateur mémorables, par exemple en récupérant instantanément les résultats de recherche ou en permettant aux internautes d’interagir avec le contenu en temps réel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connectez les blocs aux champs personnalisés ou autres contenus dynamiques</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Liez les attributs des blocs de base aux champs personnalisés et utilisez la valeur des champs personnalisés sans créer de blocs personnalisés. Grâce à l’API «&nbsp;Block Bindings&nbsp;», les développeurs/développeuses peuvent étendre cette fonctionnalité en liant les blocs à n’importe quel contenu dynamique, même au-delà des champs personnalisés. Si des données sont stockées ailleurs, les blocs peuvent facilement pointer vers cette nouvelle source en quelques lignes de code seulement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ajoutez les outils de gestion de l’apparence aux thèmes classiques</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Améliorez l‘expérience de conception des designers et créateurs utilisant des thèmes classiques. Optez pour cela pour l’activation du support des options d‘espacement, de bordure, de typographie et de couleur, même sans utiliser theme.json. Une fois le support activé, plus d‘outils seront automatiquement ajoutés au fur et à mesure de leur disponibilité.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Découvrez les améliorations de l’expérience de gestion des extensions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Il existe à présent un moyen plus simple de gérer les dépendances des extensions. Les auteurs et les autrices d’extensions peuvent fournir un nouvel en-tête&nbsp;<code>Requires Plugins</code>&nbsp;avec la liste des slugs, séparés par des virgules, des extensions nécessaires donnant aux utilisateurs et utilisatrices, des liens pour installer et activer ces extensions au préalable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Améliorations des performances</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette version comprend plus de 110 améliorations de performance, avec une augmentation impressionnante de la vitesse et de l’efficacité de l’éditeur de bloc et l’éditeur de site. Le chargement, la saisie et la navigation dans l’éditeur de site sont deux fois plus rapides que sur la version 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les sites traduits bénéficient d’une amélioration de 25% de leur temps de chargement sur cette version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le support du format d’images AVIF a aussi été ajouté.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Améliorations de l’accessibilité</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette version comprend plus de 65 améliorations en matière d‘accessibilité sur toute la plateforme, la rendant plus accessible que jamais. Cette mise à jour apporte des corrections aux réglages de contraste, à la focalisation du curseur, aux sous-menus et au positionnement des éléments, parmi bien d‘autres, qui aident à améliorer l‘expérience WordPress pour tout le monde.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">En savoir plus sur WordPress 6.5</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Explorez le&nbsp;<a

La façon de travailler avec des fichiers AVIF reste la même que pour les autres formats d&rsquo;images déjà supportés.

La plupart du temps, la stratégie de chargement <code>defer</code> est utilisée puisqu&rsquo;elle est la plus cohérente dans son comportement de chargement à partir du moment où l’attribut <code>defer</code> s&rsquo;exécute toujours une fois que le <abbr lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\" title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr> est chargé. Un script utilisant l&rsquo;attribut <code>async</code> pourrait de son côté bloquer le rendu du script s&rsquo;il est déjà mis en cache. Par ailleurs, le chargement à l&rsquo;aide de <code>defer</code> a été déplacé du pied du document en direction de la partie <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> afin que les ressources concernées soient identifiées le plus tôt possible lors du chargement de la page, et que la stratégie de chargement soit appliquée le plus tôt possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"icW3SWk68t\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/17/script-loading-changes-in-wordpress-6-4/\">Script loading changes in WordPress 6.4</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Script loading changes in WordPress 6.4&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/17/script-loading-changes-in-wordpress-6-4/embed/#?secret=ihZMwddKfG#?secret=icW3SWk68t\" data-secret=\"icW3SWk68t\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chargement des feuilles de styles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>La note de développement suivante détaille les modifications faites sur le chargement des feuilles de styles.
